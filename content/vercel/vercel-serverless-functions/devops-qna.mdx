**Technical Interview Questions:**

1. What is Vercel Serverless Functions and how does it differ from traditional server deployments?
* Expected answer: Vercel Serverless Functions is a serverless computing platform that allows developers to run backend code without needing to worry about server setup and maintenance. It uses a pay-per-use pricing model and scales automatically for high demand. This differs from traditional server deployments where developers need to manage the servers themselves.

2. Can you explain the concept of "serverless" and how it applies to Vercel Serverless Functions?
* Expected answer: Serverless refers to the concept of writing and deploying code without the need to manage server infrastructure. In Vercel Serverless Functions, developers only need to write and deploy their code, and the platform handles everything else such as scaling and resource allocation.

3. How does Vercel Serverless Functions handle authentication and security?
* Expected answer: Vercel Serverless Functions allows developers to define access control rules and encryption for their functions. Additionally, the platform handles all network security and provides secure Domain Name System (DNS) for custom domains.

4. Can you describe the process of deploying a serverless function on Vercel?
* Expected answer: To deploy a serverless function on Vercel, developers need to first create a project on the platform and add their code to the designated folder. They can then define the endpoint and configure any necessary environment variables. Finally, they can deploy their code to the Vercel platform using the CLI or the web-based interface.

5. How does Vercel handle errors and debugging for serverless functions?
* Expected answer: Vercel provides comprehensive error handling and logging capabilities for serverless functions. Developers can view error logs in real-time and use various debugging tools such as breakpoints and step-by-step execution to troubleshoot any issues.
