1. What is Vercel Domains and what are its main features?
- Vercel Domains is a service that allows users to easily manage custom domains for their applications deployed on Vercel platform. Its main features include DNS management, SSL certificate management, and fast global performance using Vercel's edge network.

2. How would you integrate Vercel Domains with a new application?
- Vercel Domains can be integrated with a new application by adding the custom domain in the project settings and updating the domain's DNS records to point to Vercel's nameservers. This can be done manually or through third party DNS providers that have built-in integration with Vercel Domains.

3. Can you explain how Vercel Domains handles DNS propagation?
- Vercel Domains uses a global anycast network to ensure fast DNS resolution and propagation across all DNS servers. This means that updates to DNS records on Vercel Domains are quickly propagated and reflected globally.

4. How does Vercel Domains handle TLS certificates for custom domains?
- Vercel Domains automatically provisions and renews TLS certificates for all custom domains added to the platform. This ensures secure connections for all applications deployed on Vercel using custom domains.

5. Can you explain how Vercel Domains supports subdomains?
- Vercel Domains supports both apex and subdomains, allowing users to manage all aspects of their domain from a single platform. Users can easily add, remove, and update subdomains through the Vercel Domains interface.

6. What are the available options for SSL configuration on Vercel Domains?
- Vercel Domains offers a default SSL configuration for all custom domains added to the platform, which includes automatic TLS certificate provisioning and renewals. Users can also choose to upload their own TLS certificates for more advanced SSL configurations.

7. Can you explain how Vercel Domains handles custom redirects and rewrites?
- Vercel Domains has a built-in interface for managing custom redirects and rewrites. This allows users to easily redirect traffic from one domain or subdomain to another, or rewrite URLs to specific pages or paths within an application.

8. How does Vercel Domains handle custom DNS configurations?
- Vercel Domains supports custom DNS configurations through the use of advanced options, such as CNAME, MX, and TXT records. Users can also choose to manage their DNS records through third party providers that have built-in integration with Vercel Domains.

9. What are the steps for adding a new custom domain to Vercel Domains?
