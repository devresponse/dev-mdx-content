# Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Vercel Scale and how does it differ from other deployment platforms?
- Vercel Scale is a cloud deployment platform designed for low-latency and high-performance applications. It uses serverless technology to dynamically scale resources according to demand, resulting in fast and reliable deployments.

2. How does Vercel Scale handle auto-scaling of resources?
- Vercel Scale uses automatic scaling algorithms to monitor application traffic and automatically provision additional resources when needed. This helps maintain 99.99% uptime and enables scaling to handle large traffic spikes.

3. Can you explain the concept of serverless computing and how it is used in Vercel Scale?
- Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure and allocates resources on-demand. In Vercel Scale, serverless technology allows for the automatic provisioning of resources based on application traffic, resulting in efficient resource utilization.

4. How does Vercel Scale handle load balancing?
- Vercel Scale uses a smart routing algorithm to distribute traffic across multiple instances of an application. This ensures that the workload is evenly distributed and eliminates any single points of failure.

5. Can you walk us through the deployment process on Vercel Scale?
- Sure, first you need to connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to Vercel Scale. Then, you can specify the branch and environment for the deployment. Once the deployment is initiated, Vercel Scale will build and deploy the application automatically on a serverless infrastructure.

6. How does Vercel Scale handle rollbacks in case of deployment failures?
- Vercel Scale keeps a record of previous successful deployments and allows for one-click rollbacks in case of any errors or issues during deployment. This ensures a quick and easy way to revert to a stable version of the application.

7. What type of monitoring and alerting is available in Vercel Scale?
- Vercel Scale provides real-time monitoring and logging of application performance, error rates, and resource utilization. It also allows for customizable alerts to notify users of any issues or downtime.

8. What kind of storage options are available on Vercel Scale?
- Vercel Scale offers a variety of storage options, including a global content delivery network (CDN), server-side rendering (SSR), and static file hosting. These options can be configured depending on the application's needs to optimize performance.

9. How does Vercel Scale handle security for deployments?
- Vercel Scale provides secure and isolated deployment environments, leveraging security best practices such as end-to-end encryption and secure system configurations. It also has built-in support for SSL and TLS encryption for all deployments.

10. Can you explain the database scalability options on Vercel Scale?
- Vercel Scale supports both SQL and NoSQL databases, and offers automatic scaling options for database resources. It also has built-in caching capabilities to improve database performance.
