# Vercel Environment Variables

As a product manager for Vercel Platform, I want to introduce you to a feature that can greatly enhance your experience with our platform - Vercel Environment Variables!

## Overview

Environment variables are values that are set within a software environment and can be accessed by different applications within that environment. With Vercel Environment Variables, you can easily manage and access these variables for your projects on our platform.

## Why use Vercel Environment Variables?

Vercel Environment Variables offer a secure and efficient way to store and use sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, and other configuration settings, without hard-coding them into your code. This allows for better flexibility, portability, and productivity in your projects.

## How to use Vercel Environment Variables?

Setting up environment variables on Vercel is simple and can be done in a few easy steps:

1. Log in to your Vercel account and navigate to your project dashboard.
2. Click on the "Settings" tab and then select the "Environment Variables" option.
3. Click on the "Add" button to create a new variable.
4. Give your variable a name, value, and a short description for better organization and understanding.
5. Click "Save" to add the variable to your project's environment.
6. You can now access this variable in your code using the `process.env` object.

## Benefits of using Vercel Environment Variables

- Protect sensitive information: Since variables are not exposed in your code, they cannot be seen or accessed by others.
- Flexibility: You can easily change the values of your variables without having to redeploy your project.
- Collaboration: With Vercel Environment Variables, multiple team members can work on the same project without sharing sensitive information.
- Environment-specific configurations: You can create different variables for different environments (e.g. development, staging, production) to have specific configurations for each deployment.

In conclusion, Vercel Environment Variables are a powerful and easy-to-use feature that can enhance your project's security and productivity on our platform. Try it out for yourself and see the difference it can make!
