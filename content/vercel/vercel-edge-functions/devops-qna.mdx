### Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Vercel Edge Functions and how does it differ from traditional serverless platforms?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions is a serverless platform that runs code on the edge, meaning closer to the end user than traditional serverless platforms. This allows for faster performance and reduced latency for applications.

2. How does Vercel Edge Functions integrate with the Vercel Platform?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions seamlessly integrates with the Vercel Platform, allowing for easy deployment and management of serverless functions along with front-end code.

3. Can you explain how Vercel Edge Functions handles scaling and load balancing?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions uses a global network of edge locations to distribute and run functions, allowing for automatic scaling based on demand. Load balancing is also handled automatically, ensuring optimal performance for each function call.

4. How does Vercel Edge Functions handle failures and retries?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions has built-in error handling and retry logic, ensuring that functions are retried in case of failure. If a function continues to fail, it can be automatically disabled to prevent further issues.

5. How does authentication and authorization work with Vercel Edge Functions?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions supports JWT authentication for secure function calls, and also integrates with Vercel's identity management system for easy authorization and access control.

6. Can you explain how Vercel Edge Functions handles cold starts?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions keeps functions warm by automatically invoking them periodically, ensuring that there are no cold starts and minimizing the impact on performance.

7. How does Vercel Edge Functions handle secrets and environment variables?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions offers a secure way to store and manage secrets and environment variables, allowing for easy access within functions without exposing sensitive information.

8. Can you walk me through the process of deploying a Vercel Edge Function?
   * Expected answer: First, the function code needs to be written and tested. Then, it can be deployed using the Vercel CLI or through the Vercel platform. Once deployed, the function can be invoked via its unique URL.

9. Can you explain how debugging works for Vercel Edge Functions?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions allows for remote debugging using tools like VS Code, making it easy to troubleshoot issues and monitor function performance.

10. How does Vercel Edge Functions handle versioning and rollbacks?
   * Expected answer: Vercel Edge Functions offers automatic versioning and rollback capabilities, allowing for seamless updates to functions without any downtime. Versions can also be managed and rolled back manually if needed.
