Expected Answers:
1. I have been working with Vercel Rewrites and Redirects for the past two years in my current role as a DevOps engineer. I have also completed the official Vercel Rewrites and Redirects training and have experience using it in several projects.
2. Vercel Rewrites and Redirects allows for efficient and flexible routing of traffic to different endpoints, optimizing the performance of deployed applications.
3. Vercel Rewrites and Redirects can be configured through the vercel.json file, where you can specify the source and destination routes, as well as any additional options.
4. In one project, I encountered an issue with HTTP to HTTPS redirect not working correctly. After troubleshooting, I found that the SSL certificate was not set up properly. I fixed the issue by configuring the SSL certificate and the redirect started functioning correctly.
5. In a previous project, I used Vercel Rewrites and Redirects to implement caching for frequently accessed pages, reducing the load on the server and improving the overall performance of the application.
6. The syntax for creating a rewrite rule in Vercel is "from": "/old-url", "to": "/new-url".
7. Vercel provides a testing environment where you can test your rewrite rules before deploying them. I also check the Vercel logs to ensure that all the rewrites and redirects are functioning correctly.
8. I usually use the "permanent" option in the rewrite rule to prevent redirect loops. This ensures that the redirect is only applied once.
9. Rewrites are useful when you want to change the URL without changing the actual content. For example, if you want to change the URL structure of a blog page. Redirects are more suitable when the content has permanently moved to a new location.
10. Yes, I have worked with Vercel Rewrites and Redirects in a multi-region deployment. I used the "regions" option in the routing configuration to specify which regions should use which version of the application.
