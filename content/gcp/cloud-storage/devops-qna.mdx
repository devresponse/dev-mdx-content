Technical Questions:
1. How familiar are you with Google Cloud Platform and specifically, Cloud Storage?
- I have extensive experience working with Google Cloud Platform and have a deep understanding of Cloud Storage and its capabilities.

2. Can you explain the difference between Standard and Nearline storage in Cloud Storage?
- Standard storage is for frequently accessed data and has a higher cost but lower retrieval time. Nearline storage is for infrequently accessed data and has a lower cost but longer retrieval time.

3. How would you secure data in Cloud Storage?
- I would use Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Signed URLs to control access and ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

4. Can you discuss your experience with managing large-scale deployments on Cloud Storage?
- In my previous role, I managed a deployment of over 1 petabyte of data on Cloud Storage, implementing efficient data storage and retrieval strategies to optimize performance.

5. How would you handle data transfer between on-premise servers and Cloud Storage?
- I would use tools such as gsutil and Storage Transfer Service to ensure secure and efficient transfer of data between on-premise servers and Cloud Storage.

6. Have you worked with object lifecycle management in Cloud Storage? If so, can you explain how it works?
- Yes, I have experience with object lifecycle management in Cloud Storage where I can define rules to automatically move objects between storage classes or delete them after a certain period of time.

7. Can you discuss your experience with versioning in Cloud Storage?
- I have implemented versioning in Cloud Storage to maintain a record of changes made to objects, allowing for easy recovery in case of accidental deletions.

8. How would you troubleshoot issues with data storage or retrieval in Cloud Storage?
- I would use tools like Stackdriver to monitor and troubleshoot performance issues and use the Cloud Storage log viewer to identify any errors.

9. How have you implemented disaster recovery solutions for Cloud Storage?
- I have set up cross-region replication and used Cloud Storage Transfer Service to maintain backups in a different storage bucket for disaster recovery purposes.

10. Can you discuss your experience with integrating Cloud Storage with other Google Cloud Platform services?
- In my previous role, I have integrated Cloud Storage with BigQuery for data analytics and Cloud Functions for automated data processing.
