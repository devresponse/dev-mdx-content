Expected Answers:
1. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses multiple layers of artificial neural networks to process and analyze data.
2. If a Vision AI model encounters missing or incorrect data, it will use techniques such as data imputation or data cleaning to handle the issue.
3. Building and training a machine learning model for Vision AI involves several steps including data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and model training.
4. Vision AI models may use methods such as feature importance analysis or decision-tree visualization to provide explanations for their predictions.
5. To ensure the security and privacy of data, Vision AI models may use techniques such as data encryption and access control, as well as compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
6. Some tools and technologies commonly used for deploying and managing Vision AI models include Google Cloud Platform, TensorFlow, and Docker.
7. A successful deployment of a Vision AI model would involve preparing the data, optimizing the model, and creating an API for the model to be used in a production environment.
8. Performance of Vision AI models can be measured and monitored through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as through A/B testing.
9. Version control and rollbacks for Vision AI models can be managed through techniques such as containerization and using a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
10. I have optimized the deployment process for a Vision AI project by using tools such as Google Cloud AutoML and BigQuery to automate and streamline data preparation and model deployment.
