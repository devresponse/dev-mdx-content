Cloud Armor is a security service offered by Google Cloud Platform that helps protect your website or applications from attacks and unauthorized access. It acts as a firewall, controlling the incoming and outgoing traffic to your applications.

With Cloud Armor, you can create and enforce security policies that allow or deny access to your resources based on IP addresses, user agents, or custom criteria. This helps prevent malicious traffic from reaching your applications or services.

One of the key benefits of using Cloud Armor is its integration with global load balancers. This allows you to apply security policies at the edge of your network, providing a first line of defense for your applications.

Cloud Armor also offers advanced features such as rate limiting and geolocation-based rules, which can help protect your applications against DDoS attacks and other common hacking techniques.

In addition, Cloud Armor uses Google's global infrastructure and machine learning capabilities to continuously adapt and evolve its security policies, providing real-time protection against new and emerging threats.

With Cloud Armor, Google Cloud Platform users can rest assured that their applications are secure and protected against potential cyber attacks.
