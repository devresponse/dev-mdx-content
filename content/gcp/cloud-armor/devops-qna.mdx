# Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Cloud Armor

1. What are the key features of Cloud Armor?
- Layer 3 and Layer 7 DDoS protection
- IP whitelisting and blacklisting
- Google-managed SSL certificates
- Custom security rules
- Centralized logging and monitoring

2. How would you go about setting up a new deployment using Cloud Armor?
- First, I would create a new backend service in Google Compute Engine.
- Then, I would enable Cloud Armor on the backend service and define the necessary security rules.
- Next, I would configure the load balancer to route traffic through Cloud Armor before reaching the backend service.
- Finally, I would test the deployment to ensure that it is properly protected by Cloud Armor.

3. Can you explain the difference between positive and negative security rules in Cloud Armor?
- Positive security rules allow traffic that meets the specified criteria, while negative security rules block traffic that meets the criteria.
- In other words, positive security rules allow known good traffic, while negative security rules block known bad traffic.

4. How does Cloud Armor handle Layer 7 DDoS attacks?
- Cloud Armor uses the Google Cloud Load Balancing infrastructure to detect and mitigate Layer 7 DDoS attacks.
- It analyzes traffic patterns and applies custom security rules to block malicious requests.

5. What types of logs are available in Cloud Armor and how can you access them?
- Cloud Armor provides both audit logs and access logs.
- Audit logs capture all changes made to security policies, while access logs record every request that is processed by Cloud Armor.
- These logs can be accessed through various methods such as Stackdriver Logging and BigQuery.

6. Can you describe the process of setting up IP whitelisting in Cloud Armor?
- First, you would create a new security policy and add an IP allowlist rule.
- Then, you would specify the IP range or individual IP addresses that should be allowed.
- Next, you would apply this security policy to the backend service.
- Finally, all traffic coming from the specified IPs would be allowed, while all other traffic would be blocked.

7. How does Cloud Armor integrate with Google-managed SSL certificates?
- Cloud Armor can automatically enable HTTPS traffic for backend services by attaching a Google-managed SSL certificate to the load balancer.
- The certificate is automatically renewed and rotated by Google, eliminating the need for manual certificate management.

8. How do you monitor and troubleshoot Cloud Armor?
- Cloud Armor provides various metrics and logs that can be used for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- These include load balancer logs, traffic graphs, and metrics such as request rate, response code, and response latency.
- You can also use Stackdriver Monitoring and Stackdriver Trace to gain further insights and troubleshoot any issues.

9. How does Cloud Armor handle traffic coming from non-HTTP or HTTPS ports?
- Cloud Armor only protects traffic that is routed through an HTTPS load balancer.
- If traffic is coming in on a different port, it would need to be redirected to the HTTPS port through a different solution, such as Cloud CDN or Cloud NAT.

10. How would you create a custom security rule for blocking certain countries in Cloud Armor?
- First, you would need to gather the IP ranges associated with the countries you want to block.
- Then, you would create a new denylist rule in Cloud Armor and specify the IP ranges.
- Finally, you would apply this rule to the backend service to block all traffic from those countries.
