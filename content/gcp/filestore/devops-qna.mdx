**Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Filestore:**

1. What is Filestore and how is it different from other cloud storage solutions?
- Filestore is a managed storage service on Google Cloud Platform that allows you to store and manage large amounts of data in a simple and cost-effective manner. It provides a fully managed, scalable, and highly available file storage solution for your applications, making it different from other storage options like Cloud Storage or Cloud SQL.

2. How would you set up a Filestore instance for a new project?
- I would use the Google Cloud Console or CLI to create a new Filestore instance, specifying the desired region, storage capacity, and file share permissions. I would also ensure that the instance is connected to a VPC network for secure access.

3. Can you explain how Filestore uses network file system (NFS) for file sharing?
- Filestore uses NFSv3 or NFSv4 as the network file system protocol for clients to access file shares. It allows multiple clients to access the same file share simultaneously, providing a shared storage solution for applications running in a cluster.

4. How do you configure backups and snapshots for Filestore instances?
- Filestore provides automatic daily backups and allows you to create manual snapshots as needed. I would configure backups and snapshots using the Filestore API or Google Cloud Console, specifying the retention period and desired schedule.

5. How would you troubleshoot performance issues with Filestore?
- I would first check the CPU and network utilization for the Filestore instance using Google Cloud Monitoring. If the utilization is high, I would consider upgrading the instance size. If the issue persists, I would look for any network or firewall configuration issues that could be impacting performance.

6. Can you explain how Filestore provides high availability and data durability?
- Filestore stores data on multiple disks in a distributed manner, making it highly available. It also uses data redundancy techniques, such as data mirroring and checksum validation, to ensure data durability and prevent data loss.

7. How would you migrate data from an existing on-premise file server to Filestore?
- I would use the Filestore online migration tool or the command-line tool to transfer the data from the on-premise server to the Filestore instance. I would also ensure that the existing applications are configured to access the file shares from the Filestore instance.

8. How does Filestore integrate with other Google Cloud services and tools?
- Filestore integrates with Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, and App Engine for applications running on these platforms to access file shares. It also integrates with Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, and Dataflow for data processing and analytics.

9. Can you explain how Filestore manages file share permissions and access control?
- Filestore uses access control lists (ACLs) to manage file share permissions and provide granular access control for files and directories. It also supports VPC service controls for additional security measures.

10. How would you scale a Filestore instance to meet increasing storage or performance demands?
- I would first consider increasing the instance size or adding more nodes to the instance if storage demands are increasing. If performance demands are increasing, I would look into using multiple Filestore instances in a cluster for better performance and scalability.
