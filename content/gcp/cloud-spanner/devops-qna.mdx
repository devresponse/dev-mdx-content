#Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Cloud Spanner and how does it differ from other database management systems?
- Cloud Spanner is a horizontally scalable, globally distributed database management system developed by Google. It is different from other databases as it offers strong consistency along with scalability and availability across global regions.

2. How does Cloud Spanner handle geographic data distribution?
- Cloud Spanner uses a globally distributed architecture with a masterless design, where data is divided into shards and each shard is replicated across multiple regions. This ensures high availability and low latency for geographically distributed data.

3. How does Cloud Spanner ensure data consistency?
- Cloud Spanner uses a distributed two-phase commit protocol and a TrueTime API to ensure strong consistency of data across instances and regions. The TrueTime API generates a global logical time, allowing all nodes to have a consistent view of time.

4. How does Cloud Spanner handle data backup and disaster recovery?
- Cloud Spanner automatically performs daily backups and replicates data in multiple regions for disaster recovery. In case of a regional outage, data can still be accessed and modified from other regions, ensuring high availability.

5. Can you explain the concept of "instance" in Cloud Spanner?
- In Cloud Spanner, an instance is a cloud resource that contains a set of nodes that are responsible for serving and storing data. Each instance is assigned a certain amount of CPU, storage, and memory resources.

6. How do you manage access control in Cloud Spanner?
- Cloud Spanner offers various access control options such as IAM policies, database-level permissions, and row-level access control. These can be configured to restrict access to data at different levels.

7. Can you explain how rollbacks work in Cloud Spanner?
- Cloud Spanner supports transaction rollbacks, where a set of changes made within a single transaction can be rolled back in case of an error or failure. This ensures data consistency and integrity in case of transaction failures.

8. How does Cloud Spanner handle schema changes?
- Cloud Spanner supports online schema changes without any downtime. It uses a schema change manager tool that automatically applies schema changes without interrupting active transactions.

9. How do you optimize queries in Cloud Spanner?
- Cloud Spanner has built-in query optimization capabilities, but as a devops engineer, you can tune performance by optimizing schema design, selecting appropriate indexes, and using best practices for query writing.

10. Can you explain how Cloud Spanner integrates with other Google Cloud Platform services?
- Cloud Spanner integrates with other Google Cloud Platform services such as BigQuery, Google Dataflow, and Google Dataproc to provide powerful analytics and data processing capabilities.
