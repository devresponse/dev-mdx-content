### Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Cloud DNS

1. Can you explain the difference between a CNAME record and an A record in Cloud DNS?
- A CNAME record is used to redirect one domain name to another domain name. It is typically used for subdomains or aliases.
- An A record is used to map a domain name to an IP address. It is typically used for the root domain or main domain.

2. How do you handle DNS zone file management in Cloud DNS?
- Cloud DNS supports importing and exporting DNS zone files through the use of DNS zone import and export commands.
- You can also use the Google Cloud Platform console or Cloud DNS API to manage DNS zone files.

3. How do you handle DNS caching in Cloud DNS?
- Cloud DNS automatically caches DNS responses for a certain period of time, which can be customized using the TTL (Time To Live) value.
- You can also use the Cloud CDN feature to cache DNS responses at the edge to improve performance and reduce latency.

4. Can you explain the concept of DNS zones in Cloud DNS?
- DNS zones in Cloud DNS represent a collection of DNS records for a specific domain or subdomain.
- You can create multiple DNS zones to manage different domains or subdomains within the same project.

5. Can you describe the process of setting up a DNS load balancer in Cloud DNS?
- First, you need to create a DNS zone for the domain that you want to load balance.
- Next, you can add the necessary DNS records (such as A records) with multiple IP addresses for the load balancer.
- Finally, you can configure the load balancer settings (such as session affinity) using Cloud DNS load balancing features.

6. What is the maximum number of DNS zones and records allowed in Cloud DNS?
- The current maximum limit for DNS zones in Cloud DNS is 100 DNS zones per project.
- Each DNS zone can have up to 10,000 DNS records.

7. Can you explain the concept of DNSSEC and its role in Cloud DNS?
- DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a security standard used to prevent DNS spoofing and ensure the authenticity of DNS data.
- Cloud DNS supports DNSSEC and allows you to enable it for specific DNS zones to protect your domain from malicious attacks.

8. How do you handle DNS failover in Cloud DNS?
- Cloud DNS allows you to configure failover policies for your DNS records using Cloud Load Balancing or Cloud Serverless Network Endpoint Groups.
- These policies will automatically redirect traffic to a healthy IP address if the primary IP address is not available.

9. How do you monitor and troubleshoot DNS issues in Cloud DNS?
- You can use the DNS Health Checks feature in Cloud DNS to monitor DNS records and detect any issues or errors.
- You can also view DNS query logs and use tools like dig and nslookup for troubleshooting.

10. Can you explain the different types of DNS records supported by Cloud DNS?
- Cloud DNS supports various types of DNS records such as A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, and NS records.
- You can also create custom records such as CAA, DNAME, and PTR records using the Cloud DNS API.
