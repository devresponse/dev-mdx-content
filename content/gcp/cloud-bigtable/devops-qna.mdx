**Technical Questions:**

1. What is your experience with Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: I have had hands-on experience with Cloud Bigtable in my previous role where I worked as a DevOps engineer and managed deployments using this service. I am familiar with its features and best practices for efficient usage.

2. Can you explain the architecture of Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: Cloud Bigtable is a NoSQL database service which uses a distributed system architecture. It consists of various nodes called clusters, and each cluster is further divided into tablets which store data. The data is indexed and partitioned for efficient retrieval.

3. How do you handle data consistency in Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: Cloud Bigtable uses a tunable consistency model where the user can choose between strong or eventual consistency for each read operation. This allows for trade-offs between data accuracy and performance based on the requirements.

4. What types of data work best with Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: Cloud Bigtable is best suited for storing large amounts of semi-structured or structured data, such as time series data, user profiles, or IoT data. It can store petabytes of data and handle high read and write throughput.

5. How do you secure data in Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: I would use Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to Cloud Bigtable resources. I would also use encryption at rest and in transit to protect data from unauthorized access.

6. Can you explain the process for backing up and restoring data in Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: Cloud Bigtable has a built-in backup and restore feature which takes snapshots of your data at a specific point in time. These snapshots can be restored to the same or different clusters. I would also set up regular backups using Cloud Storage for added data protection.

7. How do you monitor and optimize performance in Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: I would regularly monitor resource usage and performance metrics using Stackdriver. I would also use the Cloud Bigtable HBase shell and the Cloud Bigtable Visualizer tool for troubleshooting and optimization.

8. Can you walk me through the process of deploying an application using Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: Sure. I would first create a Cloud Bigtable cluster and configure its parameters such as number of nodes, storage capacity, etc. Then, I would integrate the application with the Cloud Bigtable client library and use it to connect to the cluster and perform the necessary operations.

9. What are some common challenges you have faced while working with Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: One common challenge is managing data compatibility when migrating from a different database system to Cloud Bigtable. Another challenge is optimizing performance for complex data access patterns, which may require tuning the schema and indexing.

10. How familiar are you with the cost optimization methods for Cloud Bigtable? 
-Answer: I have experience with using Cloud Bigtable instance and storage types, as well as calculating and estimating costs for different scenarios based on resource usage and usage patterns. I also follow best practices for efficient data storage and access to minimize costs.
