# Technical Interview Questions for Devops Engineer - Video AI
1. Can you explain the difference between traditional video processing techniques and Video AI?
- Traditional video processing techniques involve manual editing and manipulation of video content, whereas Video AI utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to automate the processing and analysis of video data.

2. How would you handle large-scale video deployments using Video AI?
- We would use a containerized approach for deployment, using tools like Docker and Kubernetes to manage and scale the Video AI infrastructure.

3. How familiar are you with video codecs and formats? Can you name a few commonly used codecs and their purposes?
- Yes, I am familiar with video codecs and formats. Some commonly used codecs include H.264 (for high-definition video), HEVC (for 4K resolution videos), and VP9 (for online video streaming).

4. How would you optimize video transcoding for large video files?
- We could use a multi-threaded transcoding process, where we split the video file into smaller chunks and transcode them simultaneously to improve speed and efficiency.

5. Can you walk us through the process of deploying Video AI in a cloud environment?
- The process would involve provisioning cloud resources (e.g. compute instances, storage), installing required dependencies and libraries, configuring networking and security settings, and finally deploying the Video AI application.

6. What measures would you take to ensure the Video AI infrastructure is secure and resilient?
- We would implement security protocols and access controls, regularly update and patch the software used in the infrastructure, and have a disaster recovery plan in case of unexpected failures.

7. Have you worked with AI models in production? If so, can you give an example of how you managed their deployments?
- Yes, I have experience managing AI models in production. For example, I used NVIDIA TensorRT and TFX frameworks to deploy and manage a real-time object detection model for a video surveillance application.

8. How would you automate monitoring and maintenance of Video AI systems?
- We could use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor performance metrics and set up alerts for potential issues. We could also utilize automated scaling and self-healing techniques to maintain the Video AI system.

9. Are you familiar with software pipelines and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)? How would you apply these concepts to Video AI?
- Yes, I am familiar with CI/CD and software pipelines. I would set up a pipeline to automatically build, test and deploy changes to the Video AI application, ensuring a seamless integration process for new features and updates.

10. Can you discuss your experience with video analytics and how you have used them to improve performance in previous projects?
- In a previous project, I utilized video analytics algorithms to detect and remove duplicated frames in video footage, resulting in significant storage and bandwidth savings for the client.
