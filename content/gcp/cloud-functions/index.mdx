# Cloud Functions for Google Cloud Platform

Cloud Functions is a serverless computing service by Google Cloud Platform that allows you to run your code in the cloud without having to manage servers. This means you can focus on writing your application code while Google takes care of infrastructure and scaling.

With Cloud Functions, you can run your code in response to events, such as data changes in a database or a triggered HTTP request. This makes it ideal for building event-driven applications, automating tasks, and integrating different services.

Cloud Functions supports programming languages like Node.js, Python, Go, and Java, allowing you to use your preferred language and tools. It also integrates with other Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage and Pub/Sub, making it easy to build complex applications.

In summary, Cloud Functions provides a flexible and scalable way to run your code in the cloud, without the need for managing servers. It is suitable for building event-driven applications and automating tasks, and supports multiple programming languages and integrations with other Google Cloud services.
