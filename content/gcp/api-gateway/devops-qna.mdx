Technical Questions for DevOps Engineer Interview:
1. Can you explain the benefits of using API Gateway for managing deployments?
- API Gateway provides a single point of access for all API calls, making it easier to control and monitor deployments.
- It also has built-in security features such as authentication and authorization, ensuring the safety of API requests.
- API Gateway can scale and handle high traffic loads, making it suitable for large deployments.

2. How have you used API Gateway in previous projects?
- I have implemented API Gateways for microservices architectures, allowing for centralized management and authentication of API calls.
- In one project, I used API Gateway to enforce rate limiting for third-party API calls to control costs and protect against overloading.
- I have also utilized API Gateway to handle API versioning and routing requests to the correct versions.

3. How do you handle versioning of APIs in API Gateway?
- In API Gateway, I create and manage different stages or deployments for each API version.
- Each stage has its own URL and can be accessed separately from the other versions.
- This allows for seamless deployment of updates and rollbacks without affecting other API versions.

4. Can you explain the difference between REST and GraphQL APIs and how API Gateway handles them?
- REST follows a request-response model with predefined endpoints, while GraphQL allows for querying specific data structures.
- API Gateway can handle both REST and GraphQL APIs by configuring routes and mappings for each endpoint.
- In the case of GraphQL, API Gateway can also handle the transformation of queries into REST requests for downstream services.

5. Have you used any monitoring and logging tools for API Gateway? If yes, which ones?
- Yes, I have used tools like Amazon CloudWatch and Splunk for monitoring API Gateway.
- These tools allow for real-time monitoring of requests, errors, and latency, providing valuable insights for troubleshooting and optimization.
