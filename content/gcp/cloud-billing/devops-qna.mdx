###Expected Answers:

- Cloud Billing is a flexible, automated billing service on Google Cloud Platform that allows users to pay for exactly what they use. It differs from traditional billing methods in that it is highly customizable and based on usage rather than fixed rates.
- I would use tools like Cloud Monitoring and Cost Management to identify areas of inefficiency and make adjustments to optimize costs. I would also regularly review and analyze usage reports to identify any areas for cost reduction.
- The main billing options on Google Cloud Platform are pay-as-you-go, sustained use discounts, and committed use discounts. Pay-as-you-go is a flexible, on-demand model, sustained use discounts offer discounts based on usage, and committed use discounts provide discounts for long-term commitments.
- I would first investigate the cause of the spike in usage and cost, and then take steps to optimize and reduce costs. This could include implementing auto-scaling, using pre-emptible instances, or adjusting resources based on usage patterns.
- Yes, I have utilized automation for Cloud Billing using tools like Cloud Functions and BigQuery. This allows for automated billing processes such as sending budget alerts or setting up cost allocation tags.
- I use tools like Cloud Billing Reports and Cost Explorer to track and analyze ongoing costs and usage. This allows me to have a constant understanding of costs and make adjustments as needed.
- Yes, I have set up budget alerts and notifications on Google Cloud Platform. I did this by setting up budget thresholds and selecting how I wanted to receive notifications, such as through email or in the Google Cloud Console.
- I would troubleshoot billing discrepancies by first identifying the cause, such as an incorrect billing project or missing configuration. I would then take steps to fix the issue and make adjustments to prevent similar discrepancies in the future.
- Billing projects are used to organize and segment billing and costs on Google Cloud Platform. They allow for more control and management over costs within a specific project.
- Yes, I have implemented cost allocation tags for billing purposes. I did this by setting up tags and then assigning them to particular resources or usage on the cloud.
