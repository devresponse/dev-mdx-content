**Technical Interview Questions:**

1. What is BigQuery and how does it differ from traditional databases?
- BigQuery is a fully managed, serverless cloud data warehouse that allows users to store and analyze large amounts of data in a fast and cost-effective manner. Unlike traditional databases, BigQuery uses a distributed architecture and columnar storage to handle complex queries and large datasets.

2. How do you optimize performance in BigQuery?
- Some ways to optimize performance in BigQuery include using partitioning and clustering techniques, using appropriate join types, avoiding excessive data shuffling, and using BigQuery best practices such as using optimized SQL queries and appropriate data types.

3. Can you explain the concept of streaming inserts in BigQuery?
- Streaming inserts allow real-time data ingestion into BigQuery tables. It is a continuous process where data is inserted into tables as soon as it is received, without the need for manual load jobs. This is useful for streaming data sources such as IoT devices or real-time analytics.

4. How can you manage BigQuery deployments? 
- BigQuery deployments can be managed using deployment manager, which is a tool that allows you to create, manage, and delete resources in the Google Cloud Platform. You can also use tools such as Terraform or Cloud Build to automate BigQuery deployments.

5. How does BigQuery handle security and access control?
- BigQuery uses IAM roles and policies to manage access control for resources. This includes creating and assigning roles to users, groups, and service accounts, as well as setting up data access controls at the dataset and project level.

6. Can you explain BigQuery storage options?
- BigQuery has two storage options, persistent storage and ephemeral storage. Persistent storage is used for data that is frequently queried and needs to be stored for a longer period. Ephemeral storage is used for temporary data that is only needed for a short period.

7. How does BigQuery handle data encryption at rest?
- BigQuery automatically encrypts all data at rest using Google's default encryption keys. It also offers the option to use customer-managed encryption keys for additional security.

8. How does BigQuery handle data backups?
- BigQuery utilizes a distributed storage system, so backups are not needed in the traditional sense. Instead, data is automatically replicated to multiple locations for durability and high availability.
