# App Engine Technical Interview Questions

1. What is Google App Engine and what are its key components?
- Google App Engine is a cloud-based platform as a service (PaaS) offering provided by Google. Its key components include the application server, data storage, and runtime environment.

2. How do you configure and deploy an application on App Engine?
- To configure and deploy an application on App Engine, you can use the App Engine SDK or the gcloud command line tool. You will need to create an app.yaml file, specify your application's runtime and environment settings, and then use a deploy command to upload your application code.

3. What languages can you write your application in on App Engine?
- App Engine supports several programming languages, including Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, and PHP.

4. How do you handle different versions of an application on App Engine?
- App Engine allows you to deploy multiple versions of your application simultaneously. You can configure routing rules to direct traffic to different versions based on specific criteria. You can also use automatic or manual scaling to control how much traffic is directed to each version.

5. What is the difference between automatic and manual scaling on App Engine?
- Automatic scaling automatically adjusts the number of instances running your application based on traffic levels. Manual scaling allows you to specify the exact number of instances to run.

6. How do you handle data storage on App Engine?
- App Engine offers multiple options for data storage, including Google Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, and Firebase Realtime Database. The best option will depend on the specific needs of your application.

7. How do you monitor and troubleshoot your application on App Engine?
- App Engine provides built-in monitoring and logging tools to help you track the performance and health of your application. You can also use third-party tools for more advanced monitoring and troubleshooting.

8. How do you handle security and access control on App Engine?
- App Engine offers several security features, such as access control lists, firewalls, and SSL support. You can also use Google Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user permissions and access levels.

9. How does App Engine handle load balancing and traffic routing?
- App Engine uses a global load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application. You can configure routing rules and use the Traffic Splitting feature to direct traffic to different versions or deployments of your application.

10. Can App Engine be integrated with other Google Cloud Platform services?
- Yes, App Engine can be integrated with other Google Cloud Platform services, such as Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Functions, and Cloud Pub/Sub. You can also use third-party services and APIs to extend the functionality of your application.
