# Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Cloud Interconnect and how does it differ from other Google Cloud networking services?
- Cloud Interconnect is a service that allows organizations to connect their on-premises networks to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Unlike other networking services, Cloud Interconnect provides dedicated, low-latency connections with high bandwidth and reliable connectivity.

2. Can you explain the different types of connections available with Cloud Interconnect?
- There are two types of connections available: Dedicated Interconnect and Partner Interconnect. Dedicated Interconnect offers direct physical connections between an organization’s network and GCP, while Partner Interconnect uses a service provider to establish the connection.

3. What is the difference between Layer 2 and Layer 3 connectivity in Cloud Interconnect?
- Layer 2 connectivity provides a point-to-point connection between an organization’s network and GCP, while Layer 3 connectivity allows for the connection to be extended to multiple VPCs within GCP.

4. How does Cloud Interconnect ensure secure communication between an organization’s network and GCP?
- Cloud Interconnect uses encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure the connection, such as IPsec and BGP.

5. Can you explain the difference between bursty and sustained traffic in Cloud Interconnect?
- Bursty traffic refers to a spike in data transmission that exceeds the committed bandwidth, while sustained traffic is a continuous, steady flow of data within the committed bandwidth.

6. How does Cloud Interconnect handle network redundancy?
- Cloud Interconnect offers redundant connections for high availability, where traffic will be automatically rerouted in case of a network failure.

7. Can you describe the process for setting up a Cloud Interconnect connection?
- To set up a Cloud Interconnect connection, an organization must first establish a connection with a network service provider. Then, they must create a VLAN attachment with the correct settings and configure peering on both ends.

8. How does Cloud Interconnect handle traffic between different regions within GCP?
- Cloud Interconnect uses Google’s global network to route traffic between regions, ensuring low latency and high reliability.

9. Can you explain the difference between bursting and provisioning in Cloud Interconnect?
- Bursting refers to the ability to exceed the committed bandwidth for short periods, while provisioning is the process of increasing or decreasing the committed bandwidth permanently.

10. How does Cloud Interconnect handle billing for connections?
- Cloud Interconnect uses a pay-per-use model, where organizations only pay for the bandwidth they use. The bill includes the committed bandwidth and any burst usage.
