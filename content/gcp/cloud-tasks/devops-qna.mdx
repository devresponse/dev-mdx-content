## Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Cloud Tasks
1. What is Cloud Tasks and how does it differ from other task queues in Google Cloud Platform?
- Cloud Tasks is a fully managed service that allows us to create, manage, and execute distributed tasks.
- It differs from other task queues, such as Google Cloud Pub/Sub, as it is designed specifically for applications that require precise execution and delivery of tasks.

2. How do you create a task queue in Cloud Tasks and what are the required parameters?
- To create a task queue in Cloud Tasks, we need to first create a queue.yaml configuration file.
- The required parameters for the configuration file are queue name, maximum number of concurrent tasks, and target for task execution (URL or App Engine service).

3. Can you explain the concept of push and pull queues in Cloud Tasks?
- Push queues are used to automatically push tasks to a specified URL or App Engine service for execution.
- Pull queues require us to explicitly pull tasks from the queue and execute them on our own.

4. How do you configure retries and timeouts for a task in Cloud Tasks?
- Retries and timeouts can be configured in the queue.yaml configuration file using the "retry_parameters" and "timeout" fields.
- We can specify the maximum number of retries and the maximum duration for each retry.

5. Can you explain the concept of Cloud Tasks' rate limiting and how it can be configured?
- Rate limiting in Cloud Tasks is used to control the maximum number of tasks that can be processed by a queue during a specific timeframe.
- It can be configured in the queue.yaml file using the "rate_limits" field, where we can specify the maximum number of tasks per second or per minute.

6. How do you handle failures and errors in task execution in Cloud Tasks?
- We can specify a handler in the queue.yaml file to handle failures and errors in task execution.
- This handler can be an App Engine service or a URL that will receive task execution status callbacks.

7. Can you explain how to monitor the performance of a task queue in Cloud Tasks?
- We can use Stackdriver Monitoring to monitor the performance of a task queue.
- It provides metrics such as queue latency, task execution count, and task failure count.

8. How do you scale a task queue in Cloud Tasks?
- We can scale a task queue by adjusting the number of worker instances configured in the queue.yaml file.
- We can also use Stackdriver Monitoring to analyze the queue's performance and make necessary changes to improve performance.

9. Can you explain the difference between Cloud Tasks and Cloud Scheduler?
- Cloud Tasks is used for task execution and management, while Cloud Scheduler is used for job scheduling.
- Cloud Task can perform more complex operations, such as task retries and rate limiting, compared to Cloud Scheduler.

10. How do you handle authentication and access control for Cloud Tasks?
- Cloud Tasks uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and access control.
- We can specify the necessary OAuth scopes in the queue.yaml file to control which services have access to the task queue.
