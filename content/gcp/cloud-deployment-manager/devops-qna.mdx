# Technical Interview Questions:

1. Can you explain what Cloud Deployment Manager is and how it works?
- Cloud Deployment Manager is a Google Cloud Platform service that helps automate and manage the deployment of cloud resources. It uses declarative templates to define the resources to be deployed and manages their lifecycle through a series of steps.

2. What languages and frameworks are supported by Cloud Deployment Manager?
- Cloud Deployment Manager supports YAML and Python as languages for defining templates, and works with all Google Cloud Platform resources, as well as resources from other cloud providers.

3. How would you handle authentication and access control for deployments in Cloud Deployment Manager?
- Cloud Deployment Manager integrates with Google Cloud IAM to control access to deployments. You can assign roles and permissions to users or service accounts, and use conditionals to further restrict access.

4. Can you explain the concept of 'deployment policies' in Cloud Deployment Manager?
- Deployment policies are rules and configuration settings that specify how resources are managed during the deployment process. They can control things like rolling updates, auto-scaling, and health checks.

5. In what ways can you configure rollback and error handling in Cloud Deployment Manager?
- Cloud Deployment Manager has built-in rollback and error handling mechanisms that can be configured through deployment policies. These include options for automatic rollback in case of failure, and setting thresholds for error messages.

6. How does Cloud Deployment Manager handle changes to a deployment template once it has been executed?
- If a deployment template is updated, Cloud Deployment Manager automatically compares the new and old versions and executes a rolling update to apply the changes to the deployed resources.

7. Can you explain the concept of 'type providers' in Cloud Deployment Manager?
- Type providers are external repositories of resource types that Cloud Deployment Manager can use to manage non-Google Cloud Platform resources. These can be used to integrate deployments with resources from other cloud providers or third-party services.

8. How does Cloud Deployment Manager handle dependencies between resources?
- Cloud Deployment Manager uses a declarative approach to handle dependencies between resources. Resources can be grouped into dependencies and deployment steps will be executed based on these relationships.

9. What tools and features are available for testing and troubleshooting deployments in Cloud Deployment Manager?
- Cloud Deployment Manager has a built-in testing and preview feature that allows you to validate templates and check for errors before executing a deployment. It also has a debugging option for troubleshooting specific issues.

10. How would you handle a scenario where a deployment fails midway?
- If a deployment fails midway, Cloud Deployment Manager automatically rolls back to the previous state and displays details of the failure. You can then investigate the cause of the failure and make changes before trying the deployment again.
