Technical Interview Questions:
1. What is Cloud Healthcare API and how is it used?
- Cloud Healthcare API is a Google Cloud Platform service that allows users to store and manage healthcare data in a secure and scalable manner. It enables users to ingest, store, and analyze healthcare data from various sources such as EHR systems and medical devices.

2. How would you deploy and manage a cloud-based application using Cloud Healthcare API?
- I would use Google Cloud's deployment tools such as Cloud Build and Kubernetes Engine to build and deploy the application. I would also use Cloud Healthcare API's data ingestion and storage capabilities to securely store and manage the healthcare data.

3. Can you explain how you would set up a secure communication channel between the cloud application and healthcare data sources?
- I would use Cloud Healthcare API's OAuth 2.0 authentication and TLS encryption to establish a secure communication channel. OAuth 2.0 allows for granular control over access to healthcare data, and TLS encryption ensures data is transmitted securely.

4. How would you handle data transformations and mapping when ingesting data from multiple healthcare sources?
- I would use Cloud Healthcare API's FHIR mapping and transformation capabilities to map data from different healthcare formats to the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard. This would ensure consistency and compatibility of the data across different sources.

5. Can you walk me through the process of creating a data pipeline using Cloud Healthcare API?
- First, I would use Cloud Healthcare API's data ingestion capabilities to ingest data from various healthcare sources. Then, I would use Transformation and mapping features to transform the data into the FHIR standard. Finally, I would use Cloud Pub/Sub to publish the transformed data to other Google Cloud services for further analysis or processing.
