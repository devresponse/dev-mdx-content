## Technical Interview Questions for Devops Engineer - MQ Division
1. What is MQ and how does it work?
   * MQ stands for Message Queueing and it is a messaging protocol that enables communication between different applications, systems and services.
   * It follows a client-server architecture where messages are sent and received through a central server called MQ server.
2. What is the role of a devops engineer in managing deployments using MQ?
   * The devops engineer is responsible for automating the deployment process, ensuring smooth integration between different systems and maintaining high availability of the MQ server.
   * They also monitor and troubleshoot any issues related to deployments and performance of the MQ server.
3. Can you explain the process of setting up a new MQ server?
   * The first step is to install the pre-requisites and then the MQ server software on the designated server.
   * Next, the MQ server needs to be configured with the necessary queues and channels to enable communication with the applications.
   * Finally, the server needs to be secured with appropriate access controls and authentication methods.
4. How do you troubleshoot MQ server and client connectivity issues?
   * The first step is to check the network connectivity between the server and client using tools like ping and traceroute.
   * Next, the logs of the MQ server and client can be analyzed to identify any errors that might be causing the issue.
   * If the server and client are on different networks, firewall settings should also be checked.
5. How do you ensure high availability of an MQ server?
   * One approach is to use a clustered setup with multiple instances of the MQ server running on different machines.
   * Another approach is to use a load balancer to distribute the workload among multiple servers.
   * The devops engineer should also regularly monitor the server and perform necessary maintenance, such as ensuring data backups and updates.
