## Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer for ECS (Elastic Container Service)

1. What is ECS (Elastic Container Service) and how does it differ from other container technologies?

- ECS is a AWS service that helps in running and managing Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances.
- It is fully managed and highly scalable, making it easy for developers to seamlessly deploy, scale, and manage their containerized applications.
- It also integrates with other AWS services, such as Elastic Load Balancing, IAM, and CloudWatch, to provide a complete container platform.

2. How do you configure an ECS cluster and what are the different components involved?

- An ECS cluster can be configured either through the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI.
- The main components of an ECS cluster are:

  - EC2 instances: These are the compute resources that run the Docker containers.
  - ECS agent: This is a daemon that runs on each EC2 instance and helps in communication between the ECS service and the containers.
  - ECS task definition: This is a blueprint that describes how a container should be launched and what resources it should use.
  - ECS service: This is used to define how many instances of a task should be running and what load balancer they should be associated with.

3. How do you handle auto scaling in ECS?

- ECS supports dynamic scaling of tasks using Auto Scaling groups.
- Auto Scaling groups can be configured to increase or decrease the number of EC2 instances based on metrics such as CPU, memory, or network utilization.
- When the cluster reaches a certain threshold, the Auto Scaling group launches new instances and adds them to the ECS cluster.
- When the load decreases, the Auto Scaling group terminates the excess instances, scaling the cluster down.

4. What is the difference between a task and a service in ECS?

- A task is the smallest unit of deployment in ECS, which represents a single instance of a container running on an EC2 instance.
- A service, on the other hand, is used to define how many instances of a task should be running.
- Services can also be associated with load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple tasks.

5. How do you handle updates and deployments in ECS?

- ECS supports rolling updates, which allows a service to update its tasks gradually without any downtime.
- When a new task definition is created, ECS will stop the existing tasks and launch new tasks using the updated definition.
- The number of old and new tasks can be controlled, and health checks can be configured to ensure that the new tasks are healthy before stopping the old ones.

6. Can you explain the difference between ECS Fargate and EC2 launch type?

- ECS Fargate is a serverless launch type where the underlying EC2 instances are abstracted away and users only pay for the compute resources used by the containers.
- EC2 launch type, on the other hand, allows users to have more control over the EC2 instances and their underlying resources.
- Fargate is suitable for smaller workloads, while EC2 is better for applications with more resource-intensive requirements.

7. How do you monitor and troubleshoot issues in ECS?

- CloudWatch can be used to monitor various metrics related to ECS, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and network traffic.
- ECS also has built-in logging capabilities that can be configured to stream logs to CloudWatch, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.
- Additionally, ECS provides diagnostic and debugging tools such as AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline to help identify and resolve issues in the deployment pipeline.

8. How do you handle security in ECS?

- ECS integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to provide role-based access control for managing resources within the cluster.
- IAM roles can be attached to the ECS task execution role, which allows access to AWS services, or to individual tasks, which restricts access to specific resources.
- ECS also supports network isolation through virtual private clouds (VPCs) and security groups to control traffic flow between the containers and the outside world.
