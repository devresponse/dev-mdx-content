# Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Shield Division

1. What experience do you have with managing deployments using Shield?
Expected answer: I have been working with Shield for the past 3 years, primarily focusing on deployment management for various projects and clients. I am well-versed in setting up and configuring Shield for different environments and troubleshooting any issues that may arise.

2. Can you explain the role of Shield in a deployment process?
Expected answer: Shield is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) protection service offered by Amazon AWS. Its role in a deployment process is to detect and mitigate any potential DDoS attacks, ensuring the availability and reliability of the deployed application.

3. How would you handle a situation where a DDoS attack is detected by Shield?
Expected answer: If a DDoS attack is detected by Shield, the first step would be to analyze and confirm the attack. Then, I would configure Shield to automatically block and mitigate the attack while working on a long-term solution to prevent similar attacks in the future.

4. Can you discuss your experience with configuring and optimizing Shield for different environments?
Expected answer: In my previous role, I have worked on various projects with different environments, ranging from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems. I am well-versed in configuring and optimizing Shield for different environments and have experience in leveraging advanced features to ensure the best possible protection.

5. Have you worked with Shield Advanced? If so, can you discuss your experience with it?
Expected answer: Yes, I have worked with Shield Advanced in multiple projects. My experience includes setting up and configuring advanced features such as custom ACLs (Access Control Lists) and WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules to provide enhanced protection against DDoS attacks.

6. How would you handle a situation where a WAF rule in Shield Advanced is blocking legitimate traffic?
Expected answer: First, I would analyze the traffic and confirm if it is indeed legitimate. Then, I would check the WAF rule and its configuration to identify any potential misconfiguration. If needed, I would make changes to the rule or create a new rule to allow the traffic while still maintaining the required level of protection.

7. Can you discuss your understanding of the cost implications of using Shield?
Expected answer: While Shield Standard is automatically included in all AWS accounts at no extra cost, Shield Advanced does come with a fee. I am aware that the cost is based on the number of protected resources and traffic volume. I am also familiar with cost optimization techniques to ensure cost-effective use of Shield Advanced.
