# Amazon Shield: Protecting Your Web Applications on AWS

Amazon Shield is a powerful service designed to protect your web applications running on the AWS cloud platform. It is a fully-managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service that safeguards your applications from the most common types of DDoS attacks, ensuring high availability and minimizing downtime.

## What is a DDoS attack?

A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic flow to a web application, making it unavailable to legitimate users. This is achieved by flooding the application with a high volume of fake requests or overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

## How does Amazon Shield work?

Amazon Shield helps protect your web applications by identifying and filtering out suspicious traffic before it reaches your application. It continuously monitors your traffic and automatically mitigates any potential DDoS attacks, without requiring any action from you. This ensures that your application remains available to your users at all times.
