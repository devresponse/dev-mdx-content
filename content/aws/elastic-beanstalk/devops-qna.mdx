### Technical Interview Questions:
1. What is Elastic Beanstalk, and why is it used in AWS services?
- Elastic Beanstalk is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that allows developers to easily deploy and manage their applications on AWS services.
- It automates the process of provisioning and configuring AWS resources, making it easier for developers to focus on their code.

2. Can you explain the deployment process in Elastic Beanstalk?
- The deployment process in Elastic Beanstalk involves creating an application, selecting a platform, uploading your application code, configuring environment variables and settings, and deploying it to the designated environment.
- Elastic Beanstalk then automatically provisions the necessary infrastructure resources, such as EC2 instances and load balancers, and manages the deployment process.

3. What are the different deployment options available in Elastic Beanstalk?
- There are two types of deployments in Elastic Beanstalk: rolling and immutable.
- Rolling deployments involve updating the application one instance at a time, while immutable deployments involve replacing the entire instance with a new one.

4. How do you handle application versions in Elastic Beanstalk?
- Elastic Beanstalk keeps track of application versions, allowing developers to easily rollback to a previous version if needed.
- It also supports blue-green deployments, where a new version is deployed alongside the existing version and then traffic is gradually shifted to the new version.

5. How do you monitor the performance of an application deployed on Elastic Beanstalk?
- Elastic Beanstalk integrates with AWS CloudWatch to monitor various metrics, such as CPU utilization, network traffic, and error rates.
- It also supports custom metrics, allowing developers to monitor specific application metrics.

6. What is the role of configuration files in Elastic Beanstalk?
- Configuration files, also known as .ebextensions, allow developers to customize the deployment environment by specifying additional settings and dependencies.
- These files are written in YAML or JSON format and can be used to install packages, set environment variables, and configure server settings.

7. Can you explain the load balancing options in Elastic Beanstalk?
- Elastic Beanstalk supports both classic and application load balancers, which distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.
- Application load balancers provide more advanced features, such as load balancing based on HTTP requests and support for WebSocket protocols.

8. How do you handle auto-scaling in Elastic Beanstalk?
- Elastic Beanstalk supports auto-scaling, which automatically adjusts the number of instances based on CPU or network metrics.
- It also allows developers to customize auto-scaling settings and thresholds to meet specific application needs.

9. Can you integrate Elastic Beanstalk with other AWS services?
- Yes, Elastic Beanstalk can be integrated with other AWS services, such as DynamoDB, RDS, and S3.
- This allows developers to easily access and use these services within their applications.

10. How do you troubleshoot issues in Elastic Beanstalk?
- Elastic Beanstalk provides logs for both the instance and application server, allowing developers to troubleshoot issues at various levels.
- It also supports health checks, which monitor the health of instances and automatically replace unhealthy instances.
