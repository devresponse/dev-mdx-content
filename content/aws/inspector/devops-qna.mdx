Expected Answers:
1. Amazon Inspector is a security assessment service that helps customers identify potential vulnerabilities and security issues in their applications and infrastructure. It performs automated security assessments, provides detailed findings, and offers recommendations for remediation.
2. Inspector is unique in that it is agent-based and seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, providing a more comprehensive view of security risks. It also offers predefined security rules and automatically updates them to stay current with new threats.
3. Setting up Inspector involves creating an assessment template, configuring rules, and defining target groups for the assessment. The target groups can include EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancers, and RDS instances. Once set up, you can schedule assessments or perform them on-demand.
4. Agents in Inspector are lightweight software components that are installed on your target resources. They collect runtime behavior data and send it to Inspector for analysis. You can manage and update agents through the Inspector console or API.
5. Inspector performs security assessments by analyzing runtime behavior data collected by agents using pre-defined rules. It also uses machine learning algorithms to identify deviations from expected behavior.
6. Inspector prioritizes vulnerabilities based on its severity, impact, and likelihood. It also takes into account the underlying assets' value and potential impact on business operations.
7. An example vulnerability that Inspector can detect is remote code execution through unpatched software.
8. Inspector has several customization options to reduce false positives, such as exceptions, suppression rules, and custom rules. You can also manually review findings before marking them as false positives.
9. Inspector integrates with other AWS services like S3, IAM, and CloudFormation, making it easier to perform security assessments and automate remediation.
10. Role-based access control in Inspector allows you to assign different levels of permissions to users based on their roles. This ensures that only authorized users can view and manage assessments and findings.
11. You can monitor the progress of Inspector assessments through the console, CLI, or API. The console provides a dashboard view of the assessment status, while the API allows you to track assessment runs and findings.
12. Inspector helps organizations with compliance by providing a set of predefined rules that align with security best practices and regulatory standards such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and CIS.
13. Inspector generates findings and reports that include details on the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for remediation. These findings can also be exported to other formats, such as CSV or JSON.
14. Inspector integrates with AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager Automation to automate security assessments as part of your CI/CD pipeline. You can also use it with Lambda functions to automatically trigger remediation actions.
15. Some limitations of Inspector include its limited scope of vulnerability assessment, mainly focusing on instances running in AWS. It also has a relatively high false-positive rate. Organizations may also need to supplement it with other tools for more comprehensive security assessment.
