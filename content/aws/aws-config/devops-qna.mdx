## Technical Interview Questions and Expected Answers for DevOps Engineer:

1. How familiar are you with AWS Config and what are its main features?
- The candidate should have a good understanding of the service and be able to list its features, such as configuration management, compliance auditing, and resource inventory.

2. Can you explain the difference between AWS Config and AWS CloudFormation?
- While both services handle infrastructure management, AWS Config focuses on monitoring and tracking configuration changes, while CloudFormation handles the actual deployment.

3. How do you enable AWS Config for a new AWS account?
- The candidate should mention that AWS Config can be enabled through the AWS console, CLI, or API, and that it will automatically start recording configuration changes once enabled.

4. How do you handle redeployments or updates in AWS Config?
- The candidate should suggest using AWS Lambda to create custom rules that can be triggered on configuration changes and perform any necessary actions, such as updating stack resources.

5. What are the supported resource types in AWS Config?
- The candidate should be able to list a few types, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, IAM roles, and others, and explain how each one can be tracked and managed using AWS Config.

6. How do you ensure compliance with AWS Config?
- The candidate should discuss creating custom rules or using pre-built rules to check for compliance with industry or company-specific standards, and how to remediate any non-compliant resources.

7. Can you explain the concept of configuration snapshots in AWS Config?
- Configuration snapshots are point-in-time representations of your AWS resources, which can be used to view and compare past configurations and identify any changes or drift over time.

8. How can you automate the evaluation of AWS Config rules?
- The candidate should mention using AWS Lambda to run scheduled evaluations or real-time evaluations triggered by configuration changes, and how to use Amazon Cloudwatch to monitor the results.

9. What are the limitations of AWS Config, and how can you work around them?
- The candidate should mention limitations such as not supporting all AWS resource types, limited retention period for configuration snapshots, and suggest using custom solutions or third-party tools to fill the gaps.

10. Can you give an example of a real-life scenario where you used AWS Config?
- The candidate should share a story of how they used AWS Config in a previous project to monitor, track, or remediate configuration changes and any improvements or lessons learned from that experience.
