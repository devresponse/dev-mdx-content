Technical Interview Questions:
1. Can you explain what CloudWatch is and its main functionalities?
- CloudWatch is a monitoring and management service provided by AWS. Its main functionalities include collecting and tracking metrics, setting alarms, and triggering automated actions.

2. How can CloudWatch help with managing deployments?
- CloudWatch can help with managing deployments by providing real-time monitoring of resources and applications, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues. It also offers automated alarms and actions to address any problems that may arise during deployments.

3. What types of metrics can be monitored using CloudWatch?
- CloudWatch can monitor various types of metrics, such as CPU utilization, network traffic, disk space, and application-level metrics.

4. Can you explain the difference between a metric and an alarm in CloudWatch?
- A metric is a measurement of a particular resource or application that is tracked by CloudWatch. An alarm, on the other hand, is a rule that is set up to trigger an action when a metric meets certain criteria, such as exceeding a threshold.

5. How is data collected and stored in CloudWatch?
- Data is collected and stored in CloudWatch in the form of time-ordered logs. These logs are kept for a period of two weeks by default, but they can be stored for longer periods of time by configuring retention periods.

6. Can you describe how to set up automated actions in response to alarms in CloudWatch?
- To set up automated actions in response to alarms, you can use CloudWatch Alarms to trigger various actions, such as sending notifications, scaling resources, or executing a specific AWS Lambda function.

7. How does CloudWatch integrate with other AWS services?
- CloudWatch integrates with other AWS services by collecting and displaying metrics and logs from these services. It also allows for automated actions to be triggered in response to events from other AWS services.

8. Can you explain how to create custom metrics in CloudWatch?
- Custom metrics can be created in CloudWatch by using the AWS CLI or API to publish data points to CloudWatch. These data points can then be tracked and used to create custom metrics.

9. How does CloudWatch handle high-traffic environments?
- CloudWatch can handle high-traffic environments by automatically scaling its resources to accommodate for the increased load. It also offers the ability to set alarms for metrics such as CPU utilization, so resources can be scaled up or down as needed.

10. How can CloudWatch be used for cost optimization?
- CloudWatch can be used for cost optimization by monitoring resource usage and identifying areas where costs can be reduced. For example, alarms can be set for high CPU utilization to identify instances that are not being fully utilized and can be resized or terminated to save costs.
