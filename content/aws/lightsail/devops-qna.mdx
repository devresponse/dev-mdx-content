## Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Lightsail and how does it differ from other AWS services?
- Lightsail is a virtual private server (VPS) service that offers a simplified, affordable way to deploy and manage cloud servers. It differs from other AWS services in its simplicity and targeted towards small and medium-sized businesses or developers without extensive cloud experience.

2. Can you explain the deployment process using Lightsail?
- The deployment process using Lightsail involves creating an instance, choosing an operating system and configuration, and launching the instance. Then, you can easily connect to the instance via SSH and install your desired application or deploy your custom code.

3. How do you secure your Lightsail instances?
- Security measures for Lightsail instances include setting up a firewall, enabling SSH key authentication, and using SSL certificates for secure data transfer. You can also restrict access to specific IP addresses and regularly update software and applications on the instance.

4. Can you discuss the built-in monitoring and alarming capabilities of Lightsail?
- Lightsail provides a built-in monitoring system that tracks CPU, disk, and network usage. It also offers the ability to set up alarms based on certain metrics, such as high CPU utilization or network traffic, to alert you of any potential issues.

5. How do you handle scaling with Lightsail?
- Lightsail allows you to easily scale your applications by upgrading your instance to a higher plan or by adding new instances to your load balancer. You can also use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically scale your applications based on predefined conditions.

6. What are the different storage options available in Lightsail?
- Lightsail offers two types of storage options: SSD-based attached storage and block storage. Attached storage is suitable for frequently accessed data, while block storage is ideal for data that is less frequently accessed.

7. Can you explain how to set up backups for a Lightsail instance?
- To set up backups for a Lightsail instance, you can enable automatic snapshots, which will take a snapshot of your instance's storage disks at regular intervals. You can also manually create snapshots and schedule them to be taken at specific times.

8. How does Lightsail support automatic load balancing?
- Lightsail allows you to create a load balancer and attach multiple instances to it. The load balancer will automatically distribute incoming traffic across the attached instances, providing high availability and scaling capabilities for your applications.

9. How do you troubleshoot issues with a Lightsail instance?
- Troubleshooting issues with a Lightsail instance can involve checking the instance's logs, monitoring metrics, and verifying network connectivity. You can also use tools such as CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to identify any performance issues or errors.

10. Can you provide an example of how to integrate Lightsail with other AWS services?
- One example of integrating Lightsail with other AWS services is by setting up a domain name using Amazon Route 53 and linking it to your Lightsail instance. This allows you to have a custom domain for your application running on the Lightsail server.
