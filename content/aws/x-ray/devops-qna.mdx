Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - X-Ray Division:

1. What is X-Ray and what are its key features?

Answer: X-Ray is an AWS service that provides end-to-end request tracing for distributed applications. Its key features include distributed tracing, performance monitoring and troubleshooting, and integration with other AWS services like Lambda, EC2, and ECS.

2. Can you explain the different components of X-Ray?

Answer: X-Ray has three main components - the X-Ray daemon, the X-Ray SDK, and the X-Ray console. The X-Ray daemon is responsible for collecting and sending trace data to the console. The X-Ray SDK is a collection of libraries that can be integrated into your application to capture and send trace data. The X-Ray console is where you can view and analyze the collected trace data.

3. How do you enable X-Ray for an application?

Answer: X-Ray can be enabled for an application by adding the X-Ray SDK to the application's code and configuring the application to send trace data to the X-Ray daemon.

4. Can you explain how X-Ray integrates with AWS Lambda?

Answer: X-Ray integrates with AWS Lambda by automatically instrumenting Lambda functions with the X-Ray SDK, allowing you to trace requests and troubleshoot performance issues within your serverless application.

5. How does X-Ray handle distributed tracing?

Answer: X-Ray uses a unique ID to trace requests as they travel through different components of a distributed application, allowing you to view the complete path of a request and identify any bottlenecks or errors.

6. Can you give an example of how you would use X-Ray for performance monitoring?

Answer: You can use X-Ray to monitor the performance of your application by setting up alarms based on the collected data, and identifying any spikes or errors in response times.

7. How can X-Ray help with troubleshooting?

Answer: X-Ray can help with troubleshooting by providing a detailed view of the entire request flow, including data on errors, latency, and any issues with downstream services.

8. What are the different ways to visualize trace data in the X-Ray console?

Answer: X-Ray provides various ways to visualize trace data, including a service map, a request timeline, and a dependency graph. These visualizations can help you identify any performance issues or errors within your application.

9. Can you explain how X-Ray can be integrated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk?

Answer: X-Ray can be integrated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk by adding the X-Ray daemon as an extension to your application's Amazon Machine Image (AMI), and configuring your application to use the X-Ray SDK.

10. How does X-Ray handle sampling?

Answer: X-Ray uses sampling to manage the volume of data it collects, allowing you to control the amount of data you want to gather for each request. This helps in reducing the cost and storage of trace data.
