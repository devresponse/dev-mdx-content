# Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Athena Division

1. What is Athena and how does it differ from other AWS services?
- Athena is an interactive query service that enable users to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It is serverless and has no infrastructure to manage, making it cost-effective. Other AWS services, like Redshift, require users to load data into a database for analysis.

2. How do you handle security in Athena? 
- The security in Athena is handled through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), where you can create users, groups, and roles with specific permissions for accessing and querying data. Additionally, you can use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt your data in S3.

3. Can you explain how partitioning works in Athena? 
- Partitioning in Athena is the process of dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable parts based on a particular column's value. It improves query performance and reduces costs by limiting the data scanned during queries.

4. How do you optimize query performance in Athena?
- One way to improve query performance in Athena is by properly partitioning the data; another is by using compressed file formats like Apache Parquet or ORC. Additionally, utilizing the workgroup feature to manage concurrency and query throttling can also improve performance.

5. Can you describe the process of setting up an Athena query with AWS Glue Data Catalog? 
- To set up a query with AWS Glue Data Catalog, you need to create a database within Glue and define its tables and partitions. Then, you can use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create an external table in Athena and point it to the data stored in S3 using the Glue table created.

6. How do you handle complex and nested data structures in Athena?
- Athena supports the `STRUCT` and `ARRAY` data types to handle complex and nested data structures. Additionally, you can use the `UNNEST()` function to flatten nested data and make it more easily queryable.

7. How do you handle data type compatibility issues in Athena?
- Athena has a feature called data type conversion, where it automatically converts certain data types to match the columns' data types in your dataset. Additionally, you can use the `CAST()` function to explicitly cast data types in your queries.

8. How do you schedule queries to run automatically in Athena?
- You can schedule queries to run automatically in Athena using AWS Glue workflows or Amazon CloudWatch Events. These services can trigger your queries based on a specific schedule or event.

9. Can you explain how you would use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to interact with Athena?
- To interact with Athena using the CLI, you need to set up the access key and secret key for your AWS account. Then, you can use the `aws athena` commands to manage databases, tables, and execute queries.

10. How do you handle data ingestion into Athena?
- Data ingestion into Athena is done by storing data in S3 and creating external tables that point to the data. As new data is added to S3, Athena can automatically detect and query it without the need for ETL jobs.
