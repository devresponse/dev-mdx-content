Expected Answers:
1. CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates software deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises servers, or serverless Lambda functions.
2. The deployment process in CodeDeploy involves three main steps: application revision, deployment group configuration, and deployment.
3. Rollbacks in CodeDeploy can be triggered manually or automatically using a rollback event in the deployment configuration. The platform will revert the deployment to the previous version if any errors are detected.
4. CodeDeploy supports four deployment strategies: in-place, blue-green (with or without additional traffic routing), and AWS Lambda deployments.
5. The configuration process for a CodeDeploy app involves creating a deployment group, selecting the deployment type and strategy, and setting up the application revision.
6. CodeDeploy integrates with other AWS services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeCommit, and AWS CodeBuild for a seamless continuous delivery process.
7. Some common challenges in using CodeDeploy include troubleshooting deployment errors, managing complex deployment configurations, and integrating with other services. These challenges can be overcome with thorough testing, proper configuration management, and utilizing available resources.
8. The blue-green deployment approach in CodeDeploy involves deploying the new version of the application to a separate set of instances, running tests, and then routing traffic to the new instances while terminating the old instances.
9. CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that allows for easy and scalable deployments to various environments, whereas tools like Jenkins require more manual setup and management.
10. Deployment failures in CodeDeploy can be troubleshooted by checking the deployment logs, reviewing the deployment configuration, and ensuring that the application revision is correct.
