AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to easily provision, manage, and deploy secure certificates for their websites or applications. 

With ACM, you can secure your website or application with SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring that sensitive data is protected from hackers and unauthorized access. ACM also automatically renews your certificates, eliminating the hassle of managing and updating them manually.

In addition, ACM offers a variety of certificate types, including wildcard certificates, which can cover all subdomains of a domain name, and multidomain certificates, which can secure multiple domain names with a single certificate. This allows for flexible and convenient management of certificates for different websites or applications.

Moreover, ACM integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, such as Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon API Gateway, making it easier to implement and maintain secure connections for your websites or applications.

Overall, ACM helps non-technical users easily implement and manage secure certifications for their websites or applications, providing enhanced security and peace of mind.
