Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - CloudTrail:

1. Can you explain your experience with CloudTrail and its role in managing deployments?
Expected answer: CloudTrail is a service that enables logging of API calls and events within AWS. It provides visibility into user and resource activity within an AWS account and is critical for security and compliance monitoring. I have experience in setting up CloudTrail, configuring trails, analyzing logs, and integrating it with other AWS services.

2. How do you ensure the security of CloudTrail logs?
Expected answer: To ensure the security of CloudTrail logs, I recommend using KMS to encrypt them at rest and restrict access to the S3 bucket where the logs are stored. I also suggest enabling multi-factor authentication for accessing the logs and regularly monitoring and analyzing the logs for any suspicious activity.

3. Can you explain the difference between CloudTrail and CloudWatch?
Expected answer: CloudTrail is used for logging API activity, whereas CloudWatch is used for monitoring and metrics. CloudTrail is primarily used for security and compliance purposes, while CloudWatch is used for performance optimization and troubleshooting.

4. How do you handle logging for multiple AWS accounts?
Expected answer: To handle logging for multiple AWS accounts, I recommend setting up a centralized logging account where all CloudTrail logs from other accounts can be collected. This will ensure a centralized view of all API activity across accounts and enable easy monitoring and analysis.

5. How can you track and monitor changes made to IAM policies?
Expected answer: There are two ways to track IAM policy changes using CloudTrail. The first is to enable logging of IAM events in CloudTrail, which will generate a log record every time a policy is created, modified, or deleted. The second is to use AWS Config to track and record changes to IAM policies and receive notifications for any changes.
