#Lambda

Lambda is a serverless computing service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows developers to run code without worrying about managing servers or infrastructure. This means you can focus on writing your code and let Lambda handle the rest.

With Lambda, you can easily build and deploy applications or services that require code to be executed in response to events. This can include anything from serving web pages to processing data from IoT devices.

The great thing about Lambda is that you only pay for the time your code runs, making it a cost-effective option for developers. It also supports multiple programming languages, so you can write your code in the language you're most comfortable with.

In addition, Lambda is highly scalable, meaning it can handle a wide range of workloads without any effort from your end. This makes it a perfect fit for applications that experience sudden spikes in usage.

Overall, Lambda is a powerful and flexible service that simplifies the process of running and scaling code. It's a valuable tool for developers that want to focus on writing code rather than managing servers.
