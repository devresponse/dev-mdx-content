# Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer at Amazon AWS Lambda division

1. What is AWS Lambda? 
    - AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers.

2. How does Lambda differ from traditional computing services?
    - Unlike traditional computing services, Lambda allows users to run code without having to worry about managing provisioning, scaling, and maintaining servers.

3. How does Lambda handle scaling and availability?
    - Lambda automatically scales to handle incoming requests and ensures high availability by automatically replicating functions across multiple Availability Zones.

4. Explain the concept of function triggers in Lambda.
    - A function trigger is an event or action that triggers the execution of a Lambda function. These triggers can include events from other AWS services, such as S3 or DynamoDB, or custom events through API calls.

5. Can multiple functions be triggered by the same event?
    - Yes, a single Lambda event can trigger multiple functions to run concurrently.

6. How does a Lambda function handle errors or exceptions?
    - Lambda functions have built-in error handling and can be configured to retry failed executions or send failed events to a dead-letter queue for analysis.

7. Can Lambda functions be written in any programming language? 
    - Yes, Lambda supports a variety of programming languages including Java, Python, Node.js, and more.

8. How does Lambda integrate with other AWS services?
    - Lambda can be integrated with other AWS services through event-driven triggers, allowing for a seamless integration with services like API Gateway, SNS, and SQS.

9. What is the maximum execution time for a Lambda function?
    - The maximum execution time for a Lambda function is 15 minutes.

10. How does billing work for Lambda?
    - Lambda bills you per execution and the number of requests your function receives, with the first 1 million requests per month being free.
