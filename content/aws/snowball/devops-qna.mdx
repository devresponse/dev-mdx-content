Technical Questions:
1. Can you explain the main purpose and functionality of Snowball in AWS Services?

Expected Answer: Snowball is a portable data transfer device designed to help customers securely transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. Its main purpose is to provide a fast and cost-effective way to migrate data into the cloud or transfer data between different regions and Availability Zones.

2. How do you set up and configure a Snowball device for data transfer?

Expected Answer: To set up a Snowball device, you would first need to create a job in the AWS Snowball Management Console and select the desired service, such as Amazon S3, to transfer data. Once the job is approved, you would receive the device and use the provided documentation to connect it to the network and configure the network settings according to your requirements.

3. Can you explain the security features of Snowball and how it ensures data protection during transfer?

Expected Answer: Snowball offers several security features, including 256-bit encryption, secure connections over HTTPS, and tamper-resistant enclosures. It also comes with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to ensure data integrity and erase all data from the device after a job is completed.

4. How does Snowball handle large data transfers and ensure high-speed data transfer?

Expected Answer: Snowball uses multiple parallel processing streams to maximize data transfer speeds. It also supports data compression to minimize the amount of data being transferred. Additionally, it uses robust network connections and AWS's global infrastructure to provide high-speed data transfer capabilities.

5. What are the limitations of Snowball and when is it not an ideal solution for data transfer?

Expected Answer: Snowball has a maximum capacity of 80TB for a single device and cannot be used for data transfer over 10Gbps. It is not ideal for transferring data in real-time or for frequent updates to the data being transferred.
