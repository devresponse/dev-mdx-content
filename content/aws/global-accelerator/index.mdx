# Global Accelerator by AWS

Global Accelerator is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps improve the performance and availability of your applications. It uses the global AWS network to route traffic to your applications, providing a fast and reliable network path to your users.

With Global Accelerator, you can distribute your application traffic across multiple regions and availability zones, ensuring that your users always have a fast and seamless experience. This is especially useful for businesses with a global customer base, as it helps reduce latency and improve overall performance.

Global Accelerator also offers automatic failover, meaning that if one region or availability zone experiences an issue, traffic will automatically be routed to a healthy endpoint. This helps ensure that your users continue to have access to your application, even in the event of an outage.

In addition, Global Accelerator provides detailed metrics and analytics, giving you insights into traffic patterns, origin health, and endpoint performance. This allows you to make data-driven decisions to further optimize your application's performance.

Overall, Global Accelerator is a powerful tool that helps businesses of all sizes improve the reliability and performance of their applications, providing a better experience for their users.
