## Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - FSx
1. Can you explain what FSx is and its main features? 
Expected answer: FSx (Amazon File System for Windows/Linux) is a fully managed, highly available file storage service. It supports Windows File Server and Lustre, and provides fast and durable file system performance.

2. How would you set up and manage FSx for a Windows file server? 
Expected answer: I would first create an FSx file system using the AWS console or CLI. Then, I would configure the file system settings such as network connectivity, security, and storage capacity. Next, I would create file shares and set permissions for access. Finally, I would monitor and manage the file system using CloudWatch and FSx APIs.

3. How would you ensure high availability and data durability for FSx? 
Expected answer: FSx automatically replicates data within an Availability Zone (AZ) for high availability. To ensure data durability, I would also enable automatic backups and configure a backup retention period. FSx also supports data tiering to Amazon S3 for long term storage.

4. Can you explain how FSx integrates with other AWS services? 
Expected answer: FSx can be integrated with Amazon CloudFormation for automated provisioning and management. It also supports integration with Amazon WorkSpaces for file storage and Amazon EC2 for hosting applications. Additionally, FSx can be used as a data source for Amazon SageMaker and Amazon FSx for Lustre can be used with HPC applications on Amazon EKS.

5. How would you handle storage performance issues on FSx? 
Expected answer: To address performance issues, I would first monitor the file system metrics using Amazon CloudWatch. If necessary, I would increase the storage capacity or modify the file system settings for optimal performance. FSx also supports scaling out by adding additional file servers to improve performance.

6. How would you handle security for FSx? 
Expected answer: I would first ensure that the file system is only accessible to authorized users by configuring access permissions. I would also enable data encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Additionally, I would monitor file system activity using AWS CloudTrail and enable logging for security analysis.

7. Can you explain how FSx integrates with on-premises environments? 
Expected answer: FSx can be accessed from on-premises environments using AWS Direct Connect or a VPN connection. It also supports cross-region replication for DR purposes. Additionally, FSx for Lustre can be integrated with on-premises applications and HPC clusters.

8. Can you provide an example of automating FSx deployments using Infrastructure as Code? 
Expected answer: Sure, using AWS CloudFormation, I can define the FSx file system, settings, and file shares in the template. I can also use AWS Systems Manager Automation to automate the management of file systems, such as taking snapshots and creating backups.

9. How would you handle disaster recovery for FSx? 
Expected answer: FSx supports automatic backups and cross-region replication for disaster recovery. I would also regularly test the recovery process to ensure it meets business requirements. In case of a disaster, I can restore the file system from the backup or launch a new file system in a different region.

10. Can you discuss the pricing model for FSx? 
Expected answer: FSx pricing is based on the file system storage capacity per month and the number of I/O operations. There are also charges for data transfer and data tiering to Amazon S3. FSx offers different pricing options based on usage and provides cost optimization recommendations to help reduce expenses.
