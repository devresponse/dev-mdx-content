### Technical Interview Questions

1. What is DynamoDB and why is it used?
- DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service offered by Amazon Web Services. It is used for storing and retrieving large amounts of data that require low latency and high scalability.

2. How does DynamoDB ensure high availability and data durability?
- DynamoDB replicates data across multiple servers in multiple availability zones, ensuring that data is always available and durable.

3. Explain the difference between a partition key and a sort key in DynamoDB.
- A partition key is used to partition data across different servers, while a sort key is used to sort data within a partition. 

4. Can you set up automatic scaling for DynamoDB tables? If yes, how?
- Yes, automatic scaling can be set up using DynamoDB's scaling policies, which use CloudWatch metrics to adjust provisioned throughput based on demand.

5. How does DynamoDB handle conflicts in data writes?
- DynamoDB uses a last-writer-wins approach for handling conflicts in data writes. The latest version of a particular item will be saved and reflected in subsequent reads.

6. What is the difference between a local and global secondary index?
- A local secondary index is created on the same partition key as the base table, while a global secondary index can have a different partition key and can span multiple partitions.

7. How does DynamoDB handle hot partitions and what can be done to avoid them?
- Hot partitions occur when data is disproportionately written to or read from a particular partition key. DynamoDB handles this by automatically splitting the partition into smaller partitions. To avoid hot partitions, it is recommended to use a randomized partition key or use the DynamoDB adaptive capacity feature.

8. Can you scale down the provisioned throughput for a DynamoDB table?
- Yes, the provisioned throughput can be scaled down as long as it is above the minimum throughput defined for the table.

9. How does DynamoDB handle data encryption?
- DynamoDB supports encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service. It also supports client-side encryption using AWS Encryption SDK.

10. How can you monitor performance and usage of DynamoDB tables?
- DynamoDB provides CloudWatch metrics for monitoring performance. It also supports Amazon CloudWatch alarms and Amazon CloudWatch events for taking automated actions based on specific metrics.
