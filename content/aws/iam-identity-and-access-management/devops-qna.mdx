**Technical Interview Questions:**

1. What is IAM and how does it work in the context of AWS? 
Answer: IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service provided by AWS that enables you to manage user access and permissions for your AWS resources. IAM allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and their corresponding permissions to access AWS resources.

2. Can you explain the difference between authentication and authorization? 
Answer: Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization is the process of granting access to specific resources or actions based on the user's identity and permissions.

3. What is the purpose of IAM roles and how are they different from IAM users? 
Answer: IAM roles are used to delegate access to AWS resources to an entity (such as an application or AWS service) instead of a specific user. IAM users, on the other hand, are individuals with specific credentials that are used to access AWS resources.

4. How can you secure credentials for applications running on EC2 instances? 
Answer: One way to secure credentials for EC2 instances is by using IAM roles. By attaching an IAM role to an EC2 instance, you can securely provide access to AWS resources without having to store credentials within the application code.

5. Can you explain the concept of least privilege in the context of IAM? 
Answer: Least privilege is the principle of providing users with the minimum level of permissions required to perform their job without compromising security. In IAM, this means assigning only the necessary permissions to a user, group or role to perform their intended tasks.

6. Can you outline the steps for creating a new user with IAM? 
Answer: To create a new user with IAM, the steps include: 
- Accessing IAM console 
- Clicking on "Add user" 
- Providing a username and selecting the access type (programmatic access, AWS management console access, or both) 
- Assigning appropriate permissions and creating a password 
- Reviewing and confirming the user details 
- Sending the login credentials to the user if necessary.

7. How can multi-factor authentication (MFA) be implemented in IAM? 
Answer: MFA can be enabled in IAM by assigning a virtual MFA device to a specific user or group. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to have both their password and a rotating MFA code to access AWS resources.

8. Can you integrate your existing identity management system with AWS IAM? 
Answer: Yes, you can integrate your existing identity management system with AWS IAM using identity federation. This allows you to use your existing system to authenticate users and federate trust to AWS IAM for access to AWS resources.

9. How can you monitor and audit user activity in IAM? 
Answer: User activity in IAM can be monitored and audited using various methods such as AWS CloudTrail, IAM access logs, and IAM credential reports. These tools provide visibility into actions taken by users and can help identify any unauthorized or malicious activity.

10. What are some best practices for managing IAM permissions? 
Answer: Some best practices for managing IAM permissions include: 
- Following the principle of least privilege 
- Regularly reviewing and revoking unnecessary permissions 
- Using IAM roles for delegating access instead of sharing credentials 
- Enabling MFA for all IAM users 
- Implementing a strong password policy 
- Using IAM policy conditions to restrict access based on time, source IP, or other factors.
