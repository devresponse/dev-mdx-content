Technical Questions:
1. What experience do you have working with Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: I have over 3 years of experience working with Azure Service Bus and have successfully managed deployments and implemented various features for our clients.

2. How do you ensure the security of Azure Service Bus deployments? 
-Expected answer: I follow the best practices of Azure security, such as using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and role-based access control (RBAC), to restrict access to resources and use encryption for data in transit and at rest.

3. What are the different types of entities in Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: The different types of entities in Azure Service Bus are queues, topics, and subscriptions. Queues are used for point-to-point communication, topics and subscriptions are used for publish/subscribe communication.

4. What are the key features of Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: Some of the key features of Azure Service Bus are message delivery guarantees, dead-letter queues for handling failed messages, session support for ordered message processing, and support for advanced messaging patterns.

5. Can you explain the process of setting up a new Azure Service Bus deployment? 
-Expected answer: To set up a new Azure Service Bus deployment, I first create a namespace and choose the appropriate pricing tier. Then, I create the required entities (queues, topics, subscriptions) and configure them according to the project requirements.

6. What is the difference between a queue and a topic in Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: A queue is designed for point-to-point communication, where a single message is delivered to a single receiver. A topic allows for publish/subscribe communication, where multiple subscribers can receive the same message.

7. How do you troubleshoot performance issues in Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: I use Azure Monitor to monitor the metrics and performance of the Service Bus entities, and I also analyze error logs to identify any potential bottlenecks. If necessary, I can scale up or out the deployment to improve performance.

8. How do you handle message duplications in Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: I use the message deduplication feature in Azure Service Bus, which ensures that only unique messages are processed by checking the MessageId property of each message.

9. How do you handle high message throughput in Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: To handle high message throughput, I use the partitioning feature in Azure Service Bus. This distributes the load across multiple physical nodes and enables high scalability.

10. How do you ensure reliable message delivery in Azure Service Bus? 
-Expected answer: I use the at-least-once or exactly-once delivery options, which provide guarantees for message delivery. In case of a failure, I use the dead-letter queue to handle failed messages.
