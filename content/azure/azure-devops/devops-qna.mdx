Technical Interview Questions:
1. Can you explain the basic concept of Azure DevOps?
- Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform that provides a set of tools for software development processes, including source code management, build and release management, testing, and deployment.

2. How do you handle security in Azure DevOps?
- Azure DevOps has built-in features for managing user permissions and access control. We can also integrate Azure Active Directory for single sign-on and multi-factor authentication.

3. How would you automate the deployment process using Azure DevOps?
- Azure DevOps supports automated deployment via its Release Pipelines feature. We can create a release pipeline that includes various stages like testing, approvals, and deployments to different environments.

4. What is the difference between Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment?
- Continuous Integration involves frequently merging code changes into a central repository and running automated tests, while Continuous Deployment automatically deploys code to production after successful testing.

5. How can we track progress and monitor changes in code using Azure DevOps?
- Azure DevOps offers a Kanban board and various dashboards that provide real-time visualizations of code changes, commits, and build and release statuses. We can also integrate with third-party tools like Jira for project management.

6. Can you explain the concept of Infrastructure as Code in the context of Azure DevOps?
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of automating the provisioning and configuration of infrastructure using code. In Azure DevOps, we can use tools like Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure CLI scripts to achieve IaC.

7. What are some common challenges you may face while using Azure DevOps?
- Some common challenges include managing large scale projects, integrating with external systems and tools, ensuring proper security and compliance measures, and handling complex deployment processes.

8. How do you handle rollbacks and recovery in Azure DevOps?
- Azure DevOps offers a Rollback feature that allows us to revert back to previous versions of code or deployments. We can also use backups and disaster recovery options to ensure data safety.

9. Can you explain the concept of Blue/Green deployments with Azure DevOps?
- Blue/Green deployments involve running two identical production environments, with one actively serving traffic (Blue) while the other is not in use (Green). This enables zero-downtime deployments and easy rollbacks if needed.

10. How do you ensure quality assurance and testing in Azure DevOps?
- Azure DevOps has built-in features for writing and running automated tests, including unit, integration, and performance testing. We can also integrate with external testing tools like Selenium for web applications.
