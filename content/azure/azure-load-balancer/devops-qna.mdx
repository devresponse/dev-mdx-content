**Technical Interview Questions and Answers for DevOps Engineer:**

1. Can you explain the concept of load balancing in Azure and how it works?
- Load balancing in Azure refers to the distribution of incoming network traffic across multiple resources to improve resource utilization, increase availability, and ensure high performance. This is achieved through various load balancing algorithms, such as round-robin, weight-based, and performance-based.

2. How do you configure load balancing in Azure using the Azure Load Balancer?
- To configure load balancing in Azure, we need to create a load balancer resource and then add backend pools, frontend and backend IP configurations, and load balancer rules. We can also use load balancer health probes to monitor the health of backend resources and ensure efficient traffic distribution.

3. What is the difference between Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway?
- Azure Load Balancer operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model and is used for load balancing of TCP and UDP traffic. On the other hand, Application Gateway operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and provides advanced features like SSL termination, URL-based routing, and WAF.

4. How do you integrate the Azure Load Balancer with Azure Virtual Machines?
- To integrate Azure Load Balancer with Azure Virtual Machines, we need to add the VMs to the backend pool of the load balancer resource. We can do this manually or by using Azure autoscaling groups and dynamic VMs.

5. Can you explain how Azure Load Balancer supports high availability and fault tolerance?
- Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend resources, thus ensuring high availability. If one resource fails, the load balancer will automatically redirect traffic to the remaining healthy resources, thus providing fault tolerance.

6. How do you monitor and troubleshoot issues with Azure Load Balancer?
- We can monitor the health of the load balancer and its backend resources by using load balancer health probes and Azure Monitor. To troubleshoot issues, we can check the load balancer logs and use Azure Network Watcher to diagnose connectivity and routing issues.

7. Can you explain the difference between a public and a private load balancer in Azure?
- A public load balancer has a public IP address and is used to balance traffic from the internet to backend resources in a virtual network. On the other hand, a private load balancer has an internal IP address and is used for communication within the virtual network only.

8. How do you handle SSL offloading with Azure Load Balancer?
- Azure Load Balancer supports SSL offloading, where it terminates the SSL connection at the load balancer and then sends the traffic in plain text to the backend resources. This can improve performance and reduce the load on backend resources. We can configure this by creating a load balancer rule with an SSL certificate and backend servers with HTTP or HTTPS endpoints.

9. How do you scale up or scale down the backend resources in Azure Load Balancer?
- We can use Azure autoscaling groups to scale up or scale down the backend resources based on CPU, memory, or other metrics. We can also manually add or remove resources from the backend pool as needed.

10. How can you ensure that the load balancer distributes traffic evenly across all backend resources?
- To ensure even distribution of traffic, we can use the round-robin load balancing algorithm and configure equal weights for each backend resource. We can also enable connection draining to make sure all active connections are completed before removing a resource from the backend pool.
