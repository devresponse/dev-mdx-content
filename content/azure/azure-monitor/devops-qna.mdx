# Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer for Azure Monitor:

1. Can you explain what Azure Monitor is and how it is used in the deployment process?

Expected answer: Azure Monitor is a cloud-based monitoring service provided by Microsoft Azure. It collects and analyzes telemetry data from Azure resources and other applications and provides insights into the performance and health of the deployed resources. It allows the DevOps engineers to detect and troubleshoot issues and make data-driven decisions for deployments.

2. How do you configure and deploy Azure Monitor for a new application?

Expected answer: To configure and deploy Azure Monitor for a new application, we first need to create an Azure Monitor workspace. Then, we can enable monitoring for the specific resources of the application by configuring diagnostic settings. This will send telemetry data to the workspace, where we can create custom dashboards and alerts for monitoring the application.

3. Can you walk us through the process of creating an alert in Azure Monitor for a specific metric?

Expected answer: Sure, first, we need to select the Azure resource for which we want to create an alert. Then, we can specify the metric that we want to monitor and set the threshold values for triggering the alert. We can also configure the alert notification, such as email or SMS, and choose the action to be taken when the alert is triggered, such as starting or stopping virtual machines.

4. How do you monitor the performance and health of virtual machines using Azure Monitor?

Expected answer: Azure Monitor allows us to monitor various metrics for virtual machines, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. We can also configure diagnostic settings to send log data from the virtual machines to the Azure Monitor workspace. We can then use this data to create custom metrics and dashboards for monitoring the performance and health of the virtual machines.

5. Can you explain the role of Azure Log Analytics in Azure Monitor and how it is used for deployments?

Expected answer: Azure Log Analytics is a key component of Azure Monitor. It is a cloud-based service that collects, stores, and analyzes log data from various sources, including Azure resources and applications. It is used for troubleshooting issues and monitoring the performance of deployments by providing insights and alerts based on the log data.

6. How do you integrate Azure Monitor with other monitoring tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana?

Expected answer: Azure Monitor supports integration with various third-party monitoring tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana, through the use of Azure Data Source plugins. We can configure these plugins to collect data from Azure Monitor and display it in the respective monitoring tool's dashboard.

7. Can you discuss some best practices for configuring alerts and notifications in Azure Monitor?

Expected answer: It is important to set appropriate threshold values for alerts to avoid false alarms. We can also use multiple alert rules for the same metric to ensure that critical issues are not missed. It is also recommended to configure notification preferences to be notified via multiple channels, such as email and SMS, for quicker response time.
