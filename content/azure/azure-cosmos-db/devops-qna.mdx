Expected Answers:
1. Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service on the Azure platform. Its key features include global distribution, high availability, and the ability to support multiple data models.
2. Unlike traditional databases, Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed database service. It offers single-digit millisecond latency, global scalability, and multiple data models like document, key-value, graph, and column-family.
3. Azure Cosmos DB supports multiple languages including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Azure Table storage, and Gremlin.
4. Azure Cosmos DB supports four data models: document, key-value, graph, and column-family. This allows developers to use the data model that best fits their application.
5. Azure Cosmos DB offers five levels of consistency to choose from. It also provides high availability through automatic failover and automatic scale-out.
6. Azure Cosmos DB uses indexing to achieve fast access to data. This allows for efficient querying and sorting of data.
7. In Azure Cosmos DB, a partition key is chosen based on the access patterns and data distribution. It should evenly distribute data and minimize cross-partition queries for better performance.
8. Azure Cosmos DB uses a multi-homing replication model for high availability and fault tolerance. This means that each replica set is spread across different regions and is updated synchronously.
9. Azure Cosmos DB offers a range of pricing options, including provisioned throughput, reserved capacity, and serverless. The cost depends on the chosen data model, consistency level, and regions selected.
10. In a serverless environment, developers can use Azure Functions to trigger operations on Azure Cosmos DB. This allows for cost-effective and scalable usage of the database.
