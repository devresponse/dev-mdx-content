Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Azure Databricks and how does it differ from traditional Databricks?

Answer: Azure Databricks is a cloud-based analytics and data processing platform for Apache Spark, while traditional Databricks is an on-premise platform. Azure Databricks is integrated with Azure services and offers collaboration and deployment capabilities.

2. Can you explain the architecture of Azure Databricks?

Answer: Azure Databricks is built on top of the Azure infrastructure, and it consists of several components such as the Databricks control plane, the Databricks cluster, and the workspace.

3. How do you manage clusters in Azure Databricks?

Answer: Clusters in Azure Databricks can be managed using the Databricks UI, REST API, or the Databricks CLI. You can also use automation tools such as Azure Resource Manager templates and Terraform.

4. How do you secure data in Azure Databricks?

Answer: Data in Azure Databricks is secured through role-based access control (RBAC), authentication, and encryption. RBAC allows you to control access to resources, while authentication ensures only authorized users can access the data.

5. What are the different deployment methods in Azure Databricks?

Answer: There are three main deployment methods in Azure Databricks: manual, automated, and job-based. In manual deployment, you use the UI or CLI to manually deploy code changes. Automated deployment involves using DevOps tools to automate the deployment process. Job-based deployment involves using Databricks jobs to schedule and run deployments.

6. How do you monitor and troubleshoot deployments in Azure Databricks?

Answer: Azure Databricks provides several monitoring and troubleshooting tools, such as the Spark UI, Databricks clusters logs, and the Databricks Jobs dashboard. You can also use Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for advanced monitoring and troubleshooting.

7. Can you explain how to use Azure Databricks for real-time streaming analytics?

Answer: To use Azure Databricks for real-time streaming analytics, you can leverage the integration with Azure Event Hub or Azure Kafka for data ingestion. Then, you can use Spark Streaming or Structured Streaming for real-time analytics on the ingested data.

8. How do you handle data anomalies in Azure Databricks?

Answer: Azure Databricks has built-in libraries and functions for handling data anomalies, such as the Apache Spark MLlib library for machine learning-based anomaly detection. You can also use custom code or external tools, such as Azure Cognitive Services, for anomaly detection.

9. How do you optimize performance in Azure Databricks?

Answer: There are several ways to optimize performance in Azure Databricks, such as using cluster autoscaling, optimizing the cluster configuration, using caching, and leveraging cluster pools. You can also use structured streaming and Delta Lake for faster data processing and analysis.

10. Can you explain how to automate deployments in Azure Databricks?

Answer: You can use the Databricks REST API, the Databricks CLI, and automation tools like Azure Resource Manager templates and Terraform to automate deployments in Azure Databricks. You can also use Databricks Jobs for scheduled deployments.
