### Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer

- Can you explain what Azure Functions are and how they are different from traditional server-based systems?
    - Azure Functions are serverless computing services that allow you to run code on demand in the cloud. They differ from traditional server-based systems by not requiring you to manage or provision servers or infrastructure. Instead, you can focus on writing code and the service will handle the rest.

- What are the different programming languages supported by Azure Functions?
    - Azure Functions supports Node.js, C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, and PowerShell.

- How can you trigger an Azure Function?
    - Azure Functions can be triggered through various ways such as HTTP requests, timers, queues, and events from other Azure services.

- Can you explain the difference between a consumption plan and an app service plan in Azure Functions?
    - A consumption plan only charges for the execution time and resources used when an Azure Function is triggered, while an app service plan charges for the resources allocated to the function app, regardless of whether or not it is triggered.

- How would you handle failures or errors in an Azure Function?
    - There are several ways to handle failures or errors in an Azure Function such as retry logic, logging, and using exception handling techniques to catch and handle specific errors.

- What are deployment slots in Azure Functions and how can they be useful?
    - Deployment slots are separate instances of an Azure Function that allow you to deploy and test changes without affecting the live production version. They can be useful for testing new features, and for performing A/B testing or staging deployments.
