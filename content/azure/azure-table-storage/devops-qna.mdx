#Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Azure Table Storage

1. Can you explain the concept of Azure Table Storage?
    * Azure Table Storage is a NoSQL data storage service provided by Microsoft Azure that stores structured data in the form of key-value pairs.

2. How does Azure Table Storage handle data partitioning and distribution?
    * Azure Table Storage uses a partition key to distribute data across different servers. This ensures that data can be retrieved quickly and efficiently.

3. What are the different types of operations available in Azure Table Storage?
    * Azure Table Storage supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) as well as batch operations for managing multiple entities at once.

4. How can you optimize performance while using Azure Table Storage?
    * Performance can be optimized by choosing an appropriate partition key, limiting the amount of data retrieved, and using Azure Storage Analytics to monitor performance.

5. How does Azure Table Storage handle scalability?
    * Azure Table Storage can handle large amounts of data by automatically distributing data across multiple servers and dynamically partitioning the data.

6. Can you explain the difference between Table Service REST API and Table Storage client library?
    * Table Service REST API allows direct communication with Table Storage through HTTP requests, while the Table Storage client library is a wrapper that provides a more simplified and higher-level interface for interacting with Table Storage.

7. Can you walk us through the process of setting up disaster recovery for Azure Table Storage?
    * Disaster recovery for Azure Table Storage can be achieved by replicating data to a secondary region using geo-redundant storage. This can be set up through Azure Storage Analytics.

8. How can you secure Azure Table Storage?
    * Azure Table Storage supports different levels of security, such as access control lists and shared access signatures. These can be configured to restrict or allow access to specific data.

9. How does Azure Table Storage handle data consistency?
    * Azure Table Storage offers two levels of data consistency: strong and eventual. Strong consistency ensures that the most recent data is always retrieved, while eventual consistency may result in slightly stale data.

10. Can you explain the difference between Azure Table Storage and Azure Blob Storage?
    * Azure Table Storage is a structured data storage service, while Azure Blob Storage is an unstructured data storage service. Blob Storage is commonly used for storing files, while Table Storage is used for storing structured data.
