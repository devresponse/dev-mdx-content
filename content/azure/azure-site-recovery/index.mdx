## Overview

Azure Site Recovery is a cloud-based disaster recovery service offered by Microsoft's Azure Cloud Services. It helps protect your applications and data from unexpected downtime or catastrophic events by replicating them to a secondary location.

## Key Features

- **Replication**: Azure Site Recovery continuously replicates your on-premises workloads, such as virtual machines, to Azure. This ensures your data is always up-to-date and ready to be recovered in case of a disaster.
- **Failover and failback**: In the event of a disaster, Azure Site Recovery allows you to failover your applications to Azure, minimizing downtime and enabling you to resume business operations quickly. Once the issue is resolved, you can failback to your primary location.
- **Application consistent recovery**: The service ensures that your applications are recovered in a consistent state, as it takes care of sequencing the recovery of multiple virtual machines and automates the application startup order.
- **Customizable recovery plans**: You can create customized recovery plans to fit your specific needs and define the order in which applications are recovered.
- **Cost-effective**: Azure Site Recovery offers a cost-effective disaster recovery solution, as it only charges for the storage used in Azure and the bandwidth utilized during replication.
- **Easy to use**: The service can be set up and managed easily through an intuitive user interface, making it accessible to non-technical users.
