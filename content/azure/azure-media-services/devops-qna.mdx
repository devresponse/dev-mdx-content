### Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Azure Media Services and how is it used?
- Azure Media Services is a cloud-based platform that allows developers to build, manage, and distribute media content. It is used to deliver video or audio content to any device or platform, allowing for scalable and reliable streaming services.

2. Can you explain the difference between live streaming and on-demand streaming in Azure Media Services?
- Live streaming is used for real-time content delivery, such as broadcasting a live event or conference. On-demand streaming, on the other hand, allows users to access pre-recorded content at any time.

3. How do you handle content protection in Azure Media Services?
- Content protection is handled through DRM (Digital Rights Management) technologies, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption, PlayReady, and Widevine. These technologies encrypt the content and require a license to access it.

4. How do you scale media processing in Azure Media Services?
- You can scale media processing by using Azure Media Encoder Standard, which allows you to process multiple media assets in parallel. Additionally, you can also use Azure Media Services Indexer, which enables the indexing of large amounts of media content in a scalable manner.

5. Can you explain how Azure Media Services integrates with other Azure products?
- Azure Media Services can integrate with other Azure products, such as Azure Storage, Azure Functions, and Azure Event Grid. For example, Azure Storage can be used to store media assets, Azure Functions can be used for event-driven workflows, and Azure Event Grid can be used for event-based notification and processing.

6. How do you monitor and troubleshoot issues in Azure Media Services?
- Azure Media Services provides logs and metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. These can be accessed through Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics. You can also use Azure Media Services Explorer for a graphical view of your media workflows.

7. Can you explain the different types of streaming protocols supported by Azure Media Services?
- Azure Media Services supports both HTTP-based and adaptive streaming protocols such as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming), MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), and Smooth Streaming.
