# **Azure VPN Gateway**

Azure VPN Gateway is a secure virtual network gateway that connects your on-premises network to the Azure cloud environment. It enables remote access to resources in Azure through a private connection, providing a secure and reliable way to access your applications and data.

With Azure VPN Gateway, you can create a virtual private network (VPN) connection between your on-premises network and an Azure virtual network, extending your network capabilities to the cloud. This allows you to securely access Azure resources as if they were a part of your local network.

Azure VPN Gateway supports multiple protocols, including Point-to-Site (P2S) and Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN, making it flexible to meet your specific connectivity needs. P2S VPN enables remote users to connect to Azure resources securely from any location, while S2S VPN allows multiple on-premises networks to connect to Azure securely.

Moreover, Azure VPN Gateway is highly scalable, allowing you to connect thousands of on-premises sites and remote users to Azure simultaneously. It also offers high availability and redundancy, ensuring reliable connectivity even in case of hardware or software failures.

In addition to providing secure connectivity, Azure VPN Gateway offers advanced features such as traffic filtering, route-based VPN, and multi-tenancy support, further enhancing the security and flexibility of your network.

Overall, Azure VPN Gateway is a vital tool for organizations looking to securely extend their networks to the cloud and access Azure resources with ease.
