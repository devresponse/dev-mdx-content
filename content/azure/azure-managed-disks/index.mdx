*Azure Managed Disks* are a feature of Azure Cloud Services that simplify the process of managing and storing virtual machine (VM) disks. These disks act as a persistent storage for VMs, allowing users to save important data even when the VM is shut down.

With Azure Managed Disks, users no longer have to worry about provisioning and managing storage accounts for their VM disks. Instead, they can simply create a Managed Disk and attach it to their VM, making the process much more streamlined.

One of the key benefits of using Azure Managed Disks is scalability. Users can easily scale their VMs by increasing the size of their Managed Disks, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Additionally, Azure Managed Disks offer enhanced security features such as encryption at rest, ensuring that data is kept safe from unauthorized access.

In short, Azure Managed Disks provide a hassle-free solution for managing virtual machine disks, allowing users to focus on other important aspects of their work without worrying about storage management.
