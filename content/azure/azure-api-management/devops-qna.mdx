Technical Interview Questions:
1. Can you explain the role of a DevOps engineer in managing deployments using Azure API Management?

Expected answer: A DevOps engineer is responsible for automating and streamlining the software development and deployment process using Azure API management tools. This includes creating and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, managing infrastructure and configuration, and monitoring and troubleshooting deployments.

2. How familiar are you with Azure API Management and its features?

Expected answer: I have extensive experience in working with Azure API Management and its features such as gateway management, developer portal, and API analytics. I have also used it to secure and govern APIs, enable traffic management, and implement policies for throttling and rate limiting.

3. Can you explain the process of creating APIs and API products in Azure API Management?

Expected answer: In Azure API Management, APIs are created by creating API definitions using Swagger or OpenAPI specification. These APIs are then grouped into API products which can be subscribed to by developers. Each API product can have specific access policies and usage limits.

4. How do you ensure the security of APIs in Azure API Management?

Expected answer: In Azure API Management, security is enforced through authentication and authorization policies. This includes using OAuth 2.0, API keys, and client certificates to authenticate API calls. We can also set up IP whitelisting and IIS web application firewall to protect against attacks.

5. How do you handle API versioning in Azure API Management?

Expected answer: We can handle API versioning by using routing rules and URL templates to redirect calls to different versions of the same API. We can also specify versioning policies in API products to control access to specific versions.

6. Can you explain how you would monitor and troubleshoot API deployments in Azure API Management?

Expected answer: In Azure API Management, I would use the built-in analytics capabilities to monitor API usage, performance, and errors. I can also set up alerts to be notified of any issues. For troubleshooting, I would use diagnostic logging and the Azure portal to view and analyze logs.

7. In your opinion, what are the benefits of using Azure API Management over other API management tools?

Expected answer: Azure API Management is a comprehensive and scalable solution that offers a secure gateway for APIs, a developer portal for managing subscriptions, and rich analytics for monitoring API performance. It also integrates well with other Azure services and has a user-friendly interface for managing APIs.
