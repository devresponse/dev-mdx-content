Azure Lighthouse is a management solution offered by Azure Cloud Services that allows businesses to manage and monitor multiple Azure cloud environments from a single, centralized location. This means that businesses can easily manage and provide services to their customers or clients who are also using Azure services.

With Azure Lighthouse, businesses can have a unified view of their customers' Azure resources, making it easier to manage and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This also allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in delivering Azure-based services to customers.

Furthermore, Azure Lighthouse offers advanced access control and delegation, enabling businesses to securely grant permissions to their customers for managing their own Azure resources. This reduces the need for constant communication and streamlines the process of delivering services.

In summary, Azure Lighthouse is a powerful tool for businesses to efficiently manage and provide services to their customers who are using Azure cloud services, providing a seamless and secure experience for all parties involved.
