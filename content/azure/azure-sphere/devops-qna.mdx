Technical Questions:
1. What is Azure Sphere and how does it differ from other Azure services?
Expected Answer: Azure Sphere is a secure, high-level operating system and cloud platform that provides internet connectivity and security for IoT devices. It differs from other Azure services in its focus on securing IoT devices and its integration of both hardware and software components.

2. Can you explain the components of Azure Sphere and how they work together?
Expected Answer: The three key components of Azure Sphere are the microcontroller unit (MCU), the secure operating system (OS), and the cloud-based security service. The MCU is responsible for running the applications and communicating with the OS and security service, while the OS provides a secure environment for these applications to run. The security service provides updates and protections for the devices and their applications.

3. How would you set up a deployment pipeline for Azure Sphere?
Expected Answer: I would use the Azure Sphere SDK to build and sign the application, then use Azure DevOps to create a pipeline for automated testing and deployment to the Azure Sphere devices. The pipeline would also include testing for security vulnerabilities and compatibility with the secure OS.

4. What security considerations should be taken into account when deploying to Azure Sphere?
Expected Answer: There are several security measures that should be implemented when deploying to Azure Sphere, such as using secure boot to ensure the integrity of the OS, implementing network segmentation to limit access to the devices, and following secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

5. How would you monitor and troubleshoot deployments on Azure Sphere devices?
Expected Answer: I would use Azure Monitor to track the status and performance of the devices, as well as any issues that may arise. For troubleshooting, I would use the Azure Sphere CLI to connect to the devices and check their logs for any errors or failures.
