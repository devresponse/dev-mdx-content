### **Technical Interview Questions**

1. What is Azure Blockchain Service and how does it work?
   * Azure Blockchain Service is a fully-managed, cloud-based blockchain service that allows organizations to create, manage and govern consortium blockchain networks. It is built on top of the Ethereum platform.
2. What are the key features of Azure Blockchain Service?
   * Some key features of Azure Blockchain Service include scalability, high availability, built-in security and compliance, and easy deployment and management.
3. How do you deploy and manage a blockchain network using Azure Blockchain Service?
   * Azure Blockchain Service offers a user-friendly interface and tools to easily deploy and manage a blockchain network. This includes creating and configuring nodes, managing network policies, monitoring network activity, and performing network upgrades.
4. Can you explain the consensus algorithm used in Azure Blockchain Service?
   * Azure Blockchain Service uses the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, which is a streamlined and energy-efficient version of the traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. In PoA, network participants are known and trusted, making it more suitable for private, enterprise blockchain networks.
5. How does Azure Blockchain Service ensure the security of the network and transactions?
   * Azure Blockchain Service provides built-in security measures such as role-based access control, encryption at rest, and secure key management. It also utilizes Azure Active Directory for user authentication and authorization.
6. How can you monitor and troubleshoot issues in a deployed blockchain network?
   * Azure Blockchain Service offers real-time network monitoring and analytics, as well as logging and auditing capabilities. It also integrates with Azure Monitor, which allows for alerting and automatic remediation of issues.
7. Can you explain how Azure Blockchain Service integrates with existing applications and systems?
   * Azure Blockchain Service offers a REST API, SDKs, and connectors for popular programming languages and applications. It also supports integration with Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions for automation and data processing.
8. Are there any limitations or best practices to consider when deploying a blockchain network with Azure Blockchain Service?
   * Yes, some limitations include network size and node capacity, as well as transaction throughput. Best practices include proper network design, node management, and using appropriate security controls.
9. How does Azure Blockchain Service handle network upgrades and version control?
   * Azure Blockchain Service allows for seamless network upgrades with minimal downtime through its built-in version control mechanism. This ensures all network participants are running on the same version and reduces the risk of network forks.
10. Can you walk us through the process of deploying a blockchain network with Azure Blockchain Service?
   * The process includes creating an Azure Blockchain Service instance, configuring network policies and security settings, adding and configuring nodes, deploying and testing a smart contract, and finally, granting access to network participants.
