# Technical Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Azure Virtual Machines

As a hiring manager for the Azure Virtual Machines division, you play a crucial role in finding an experienced and knowledgeable DevOps engineer. To prepare for the technical interview, it is essential to have a well-prepared set of questions and discussion topics related to Azure Virtual Machines. Here is a detailed list of technical questions and discussion topics that will help you evaluate the candidate's skills and expertise.

##1. What is Azure Virtual Machines and its key features?

- Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that offers on-demand, scalable computing resources in the cloud.
- Key features of Azure VMs include flexibility in choosing the operating system, customizing the infrastructure, and seamless integration with other Azure services.

##2. How does Azure Virtual Machines differ from traditional on-premise VMs?

- Traditional on-premise VMs require physical servers and hardware, while Azure VMs operate entirely in the cloud.
- Azure VMs offer more scalability and flexibility than on-premise VMs, as resources can be easily scaled up or down as per the needs.

##3. Explain the deployment process of Azure Virtual Machines.

- The first step in deploying Azure VMs is to choose the desired VM size and operating system from the Azure marketplace.
- Next, you need to set up the network and storage settings for the VM.
- After that, you can select the deployment model, i.e., Resource Manager or classic, and configure the settings accordingly.
- Finally, you can deploy the VM and monitor its status from the Azure portal.

##4. How do you manage and monitor resources in Azure Virtual Machines?

- Azure VMs offer various monitoring and management tools, such as Azure Monitor, Azure Automation, and Azure Resource Manager templates.
- These tools allow you to monitor resource usage, track performance, configure alerts, and automate tasks for efficient resource management.

##5. Can you explain the concept of Azure VM Availability Sets?

- Azure VM Availability Sets allow you to distribute VMs across multiple fault domains and update domains to ensure high availability.
- The fault domain represents a group of physical servers that share a common power source and network switch, while the update domain is a logical grouping of VMs that are updated during maintenance.

##6. How do you handle disaster recovery for Azure VMs?

- Azure Site Recovery is a disaster recovery as a service (DRaaS) tool that enables replication of VMs and data to a different Azure region for disaster recovery.
- It also allows you to automate the failover and failback process for a quick recovery in case of any disaster.

##7. How do you manage access and security of Azure VMs?

- Azure VMs offer various security features, such as network security groups, access control lists, and Azure Key Vault, to manage access and secure the VMs and their resources.
- Network security groups allow you to control network traffic, while access control lists provide fine-grained access control for Azure resources.
- Azure Key Vault is used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and certificates, securely.

##8. How do you handle updates and patches for Azure VMs?

- Azure VMs allow you to configure automated patching for both OS and application updates.
- You can schedule the updates, configure the maintenance window, and control the reboot settings as per your preference.

##9. How do you integrate Azure Virtual Machines with other Azure services?

- Azure Virtual Machines offer seamless integration with other Azure services, such as Azure Storage, Azure Load Balancer, and Azure Virtual Networks.
- This integration enables you to use these services to enhance the functionality and performance of your VMs.

##10. How do you troubleshoot common issues in Azure VMs?

- Azure offers various troubleshooting tools and techniques, such as Azure Advisor, Diagnostics Settings, and Azure Advanced Diagnostics, to troubleshoot common VM issues.
- These tools provide recommendations and insights to improve performance, troubleshoot errors, and optimize resource usage.
