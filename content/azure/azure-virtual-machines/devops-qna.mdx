Technical Questions:
1. What is Azure Virtual Machines and how does it differ from traditional on-premises virtual machines?
Expected answer: Azure Virtual Machines is a cloud-based service that provides users with the ability to create and manage virtual machines on the cloud, instead of on physical servers. It differs from traditional virtual machines as it allows for greater scalability, flexibility and cost-effectiveness.

2. What are the different types of virtual machines available in Azure and how are they categorized?
Expected answer: The different types of virtual machines available in Azure are categorized based on their usage and workload. This includes General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized and GPU.

3. How can you ensure high availability for your virtual machines in Azure?
Expected answer: One can ensure high availability for virtual machines in Azure by leveraging features such as Availability Sets, Availability Zones and Load Balancers. Additionally, using managed disks and taking regular backups can also contribute to high availability.

4. How can you optimize the performance of your virtual machines in Azure?
Expected answer: There are several ways to optimize the performance of virtual machines in Azure, such as choosing the right instance size, using managed disks, utilizing Azure Cache for Redis, and leveraging Azure Load Balancer for load distribution.

5. What are the different options for managing storage for virtual machines in Azure?
Expected answer: There are two options for managing storage for virtual machines in Azure: Managed Disks and Unmanaged Disks. Managed Disks provide simplified storage management, while Unmanaged Disks provide more control over storage configurations.
