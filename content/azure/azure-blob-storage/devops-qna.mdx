Technical Interview Questions:

1. What is Azure Blob Storage and how does it differ from other storage options in Azure?

Answer:
- Azure Blob Storage is a cloud-based storage service offered by Microsoft Azure that is optimized for storing vast amounts of unstructured data.
- It differs from other Azure storage options such as Azure File Storage and Azure Queue Storage as it is specifically designed for storing large files and objects.

2. What are the different types of blobs available in Azure Blob Storage?

Answer:
- There are three types of blobs: block blobs, append blobs, and page blobs.
- Block blobs are designed for storing and managing large files, while append blobs are used for appending data to an existing blob.
- Page blobs are optimized for storing random access files, such as virtual hard drives.

3. How is data accessed in Azure Blob Storage?

Answer:
- Data can be accessed through a REST API, Azure Storage Client Library, or by using a tool like Azure Storage Explorer.
- Blobs can also be accessed through a URL generated in the Azure portal.

4. How can you restrict access to your data in Azure Blob Storage?

Answer:
- Azure Blob Storage supports two types of shared access signatures (SAS) that can be used to control access to your data: service SAS and account SAS.
- Service SAS restricts access to a specific blob or container, while account SAS restricts access to multiple resources within an storage account.

5. Can you explain how blob versioning works in Azure Blob Storage?

Answer:
- Blob versioning allows you to store and retrieve multiple versions of a blob.
- Whenever a blob is modified or deleted, a new version is created and the previous version is preserved.
- Blob versioning must be enabled at the storage account level and can be managed through lifecycle management policies.

6. How can you synchronize files between your local environment and Azure Blob Storage?

Answer:
- Azure Blob Storage supports the AzCopy tool, which allows you to copy files to and from Azure Blob Storage using the command line or a web interface.
- You can also use the Azure Storage Client Library or Azure Data Factory to sync files between your local environment and Azure Blob Storage.

7. How do you handle disaster recovery with Azure Blob Storage?

Answer:
- Azure Blob Storage offers geo-redundant storage (GRS) and geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) options for disaster recovery.
- GRS automatically replicates your data to a secondary region, while GZRS replicates your data to another data center in the same region.
- You can also use Azure Site Recovery to create a disaster recovery plan for your storage account.
