### Task: Configure and Manage Azure Blob Storage

#### Objective:
Establish and maintain robust, scalable, and secure blob storage solutions to meet the company's data storage needs.

#### Requirements:

1. **Storage Account Setup:**
   - Create new Azure storage accounts as needed, ensuring they align with organizational naming conventions and resource group strategies.
   - Configure storage account settings for optimal performance, security, and cost-effectiveness.

2. **Access Control:**
   - Implement strict access controls using Azure Active Directory and role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to storage accounts based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Manage shared access signatures (SAS) for fine-grained access control to blob containers and data.

3. **Security Configurations:**
   - Enable and configure advanced threat protection to monitor and protect blob storage from unauthorized access and threats.
   - Implement encryption-at-rest using Azure Storage Service Encryption and encryption-in-transit with HTTPS to secure data.

4. **Performance Management:**
   - Choose the appropriate access tier (Hot, Cool, or Archive) based on usage patterns and data access requirements.
   - Optimize performance by configuring blob storage on premium performance tiers for high-throughput and low-latency scenarios.

5. **Data Replication and Redundancy:**
   - Set up data replication options such as Locally Redundant Storage (LRS), Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS), or Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS) according to the data criticality and recovery requirements.
   - Regularly review and adjust the replication strategies to align with changing business continuity and disaster recovery objectives.

6. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Monitor and analyze storage usage and costs using Azure Cost Management tools.
   - Implement cost-saving measures such as moving infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage tiers or deleting redundant or obsolete data.

7. **Compliance and Auditing:**
   - Ensure that the storage solutions comply with industry standards and regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.
   - Set up logging and auditing using Azure Monitor and Azure Storage Analytics to track access patterns and anomalies.

8. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document all configurations, procedures, and changes made to the Azure Blob Storage environments.
   - Provide regular reports on storage usage, performance metrics, security incidents, and cost management efforts.

#### Deliverables:
- Configured and operational Azure Blob Storage accounts.
- Documentation detailing the configuration settings, access controls, and security measures implemented.
- Monthly reports on performance, security, and cost optimization.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Effectiveness in implementing secure and cost-efficient storage solutions.
- Accuracy and timeliness of the storage configuration and management.
- Proactive management of storage performance and costs.
