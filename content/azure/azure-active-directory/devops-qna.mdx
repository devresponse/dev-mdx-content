# Interview Questions for DevOps Engineer - Azure Active Directory

1. Can you walk me through the process of setting up a new deployment in Azure Active Directory?

Expected answer:
- The first step would be to create a new deployment in the Azure portal.
- Then, I would configure the Active Directory settings, including creating a new tenant if necessary.
- Next, I would set up authentication and authorization for the deployment, including setting up single sign-on and multi-factor authentication.
- Once the initial configuration is complete, I would add users and groups to the deployment and assign them roles and permissions as needed.
- Finally, I would test the deployment to ensure everything is working correctly.

2. How do you handle security and compliance in Azure Active Directory?

Expected answer:
- Security and compliance are critical aspects of Azure Active Directory.
- To ensure security, I would regularly review and update access control policies and permissions for users and apps.
- I would also regularly audit and monitor the deployment to detect any potential security threats.
- For compliance, I would configure data governance policies and implement features like data loss prevention to protect sensitive information.

3. Can you explain how to integrate Azure Active Directory with other services in Azure?

Expected answer:
- Yes, Azure Active Directory can easily be integrated with other services in Azure.
- One way to do this is through Azure AD Connect, which allows for single sign-on across multiple applications and services.
- For example, it can be used to integrate with Azure DevOps, so users can log in with their Azure AD credentials.
- Alternatively, Azure Active Directory can also be integrated with other services using custom APIs and protocols such as OAuth 2.0.

4. What is Azure AD B2C, and how is it different from the standard Azure Active Directory?

Expected answer:
- Azure AD B2C is a cloud-based identity and access management service for consumer-facing applications.
- It is different from the standard Azure Active Directory, which is primarily used for enterprise applications and services.
- Azure AD B2C offers features like social identity integration, which allows users to log in using their social media accounts.
- It also supports self-service registration and password reset, making it ideal for use in consumer-facing applications.

5. How do you handle disaster recovery for Azure Active Directory?

Expected answer:
- I would use Azure Active Directory Connect to replicate user and directory data to a secondary Azure AD tenant in another region.
- This way, if the primary tenant experiences an outage, the secondary tenant can be used for failover.
- Additionally, I would regularly back up the Active Directory settings and configurations to ensure that they can be quickly restored in case of a disaster.
