# Technical Interview Questions for Devops Engineer - Azure App Service

1. What is Azure App Service and how does it differ from other Azure services?
- Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering in Azure that allows developers to quickly build, deploy, and scale web, mobile, and API applications. It is different from other Azure services in that it provides a fully managed platform for application deployment and management, eliminating the need for infrastructure management.

2. What types of applications can be hosted on Azure App Service?
- Azure App Service supports a wide range of application types including web apps, mobile apps, API apps, and Logic Apps.

3. How do you scale an Azure App Service application?
- Azure App Service offers two main forms of scaling: vertical scaling (increasing the resources of a single instance) and horizontal scaling (adding more instances to an application). This can be done manually or automatically based on defined thresholds.

4. What are deployment slots in Azure App Service and how are they useful?
- Deployment slots in Azure App Service allow for the creation of separate staging environments that can be used for testing and validation. This allows for seamless deployment of updates to production without affecting the live application.

5. How do you secure an Azure App Service application?
- Azure App Service provides various security features such as SSL certificates, Azure AD authentication, and access control with role-based access control (RBAC). Additionally, network security groups (NSGs) can be used to restrict traffic to and from the application.

6. How does Azure App Service integrate with source control systems?
- Azure App Service has built-in integration with source control systems such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Azure Repos. This allows for easy deployment of code changes to the application.

7. What is continuous deployment and how can it be set up in Azure App Service?
- Continuous deployment is the process of automatically deploying code changes to an application as soon as they are committed to the source control system. This can be set up in Azure App Service by configuring a continuous deployment trigger for the desired source control repository.

8. How does Azure App Service handle scaling during peak traffic periods?
- Azure App Service has auto-scaling capabilities that can be configured to automatically adjust the number of instances based on defined thresholds. This ensures that the application can handle increased traffic during peak periods.

9. How do you troubleshoot issues with an Azure App Service application?
- Azure App Service provides several tools for troubleshooting issues, such as application logs, failed request tracing, and live stream debugging. Additionally, the Azure portal provides insights and metrics to help identify and resolve any performance issues.

10. How does Azure App Service integrate with other Azure services?
- Azure App Service integrates with other Azure services such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage, and Azure Functions, allowing for a comprehensive application stack to be built using various Azure services.
